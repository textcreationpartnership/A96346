            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF any of the Criticks of this Age ſhould cenſure my Acceſs to your Lordſhips ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance now, being an abſolute Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to you before; I hope he will be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfi'd when I ſhall tell him, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes of your Vertuous and Pious Life, were ſo ſweet, the Commendations given me of your moſt Illuſtrious and Antient Family, ſo great, and extraordinary Charming, that I ſoon was mov'd to purchaſe ſo great and bleſs'd a Treaſure; for a Man muſt not, nor can he (if he would) be a Stranger to Vertue
<pb facs="tcp:151886:5"/>whereever 'tis lodg'd; being it is that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect good which makes the complement of a happy life, and it alſo has an attractive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to draw all mortals, even the moſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among 'em to its admiration and praiſe.</p>
            <p>It's allow'd by all who pretend to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of your Lordſhips Pedigree, that Fortitude (which we call the contempt of all hazards agreeing with reaſon) was the raiſing of your firſt Progenitour, and a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Prerogative ever ſince entail'd on all his Poſterity. Tradition which alone gives life to the beſt of Hiſtorys, and which alone can revive in our thoughts the memory and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very too, of paſs'd Tranſactions; will tell you that He was one of the greateſt <hi>Hero's</hi> of his Age, a daring man, who fear'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than the weakneſs of being affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with Popular Glory; yet did the World extol very much the greatneſs of his Courage, the Wiſdom of his Conduct, and the famous Renown of all his glorious actions in <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> where He was imploy'd by his Imperial Majeſty againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> againſt whom he often fought, and ſo often worſted, that their inſulting Courage fail'd them in ſo great a meaſure,

               </note> as his very name became as dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them, as that of <hi>Talbot</hi> was formidable to the <hi>French;</hi> nay it was with them an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
<pb facs="tcp:151886:5"/>means to quiet their unruly Children, to threaten them with the great <hi>Arundels</hi> coming.</p>
            <p>His Valour purchas'd him ſo great an Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with his General, that he was the only perſon of all his Field Officers, he reli'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to manage the moſt perilous enterprizes of War, and ſuch Adventures as were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to terrify the moſt expert in Martial Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. He was no leſs in His Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's favour, Who had on ſeveral Occaſions made experiment of his wiſe Conduct, firm Reſolution, and great Courage;
<note place="margin">Epran <hi>on the South ſide of the</hi> Danube <hi>was taken by Sir</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del <hi>of</hi> Warder <hi>in the year</hi> 1595. <hi>for which brave Action the Emperour</hi> Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him a Count of the Empire.</hi>
               </note> and therefore having reſolv'd in Counſel to lay Siege to a ſtrong City which the <hi>Turks</hi> had poſſeſſed for ſeveral years before, He appointed him chief Commander of a conſiderable Army with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to reduce it to his Obedience, which he moſt willingly accepted; for he was more ambitious of being reputed Loyal to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, than made happy with all the Riches and Treaſures of the World; whereupon he took leave of His Majeſty, and immediately march'd towards the place; where he was no ſooner arriv'd, after having drawn his Lines, and provided all other neceſſary things for the ſecurity and welfare of his Camp, but he rais'd his Batterys, planted his Cannons, and in a ſhort time made a conſiderable breach in the
<pb facs="tcp:151886:6"/>Walls; and then reſolving upon a general Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, he call'd a Council of War, and ſpake to them in this manner. <hi>Gentlemen, the War we have in hand is glorious becauſe it is for our Religion, We fight againſt a People that are Gods enemys as well as ours; and the work we are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is both honourable and meritorious, for we are certain that He is altogether as powerful to defend us from the annoiance of our enemies,

            </p>
            <p>This ſhort and efficacious Speech inflam'd the hearts of all his Officers and Soldiers ſo extreamly, that they all Vow'd unanimouſly to follow him; though they ſhould loſe their lives in the action; which he immediately began, and marching in the Front of them, gave the firſt on-ſet like a Thundring <hi>Jove</hi> in his greateſt Storm;

He was the very firſt Perſon that enter'd the Breach, Seal'd the Walls, and with his own hands pull'd down the <hi>Half Moon,</hi> and planted the <hi>Spread Eagle</hi> in its place.</p>
            <p>This no leſs brave than bold Attempt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd the Enemy of Courage, made 'em quit their Poſts confuſedly, and brought ſo great a Conſternation upon the Citizens that they all laid down their Arms,

His Imperial Majeſty was no leſs joyful at the good ſucceſs of his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Champion, neither was he remiſs to gratify
<pb facs="tcp:151886:7"/>him for ſo famous an Action, for at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Court he created him with all the Solemnity imaginable <hi>Count of the Empire,</hi> and entail'd the ſame Honour upon the Heirs of his Family for ever, with many other Priviledges and ſpecial Favours, which are inſeparable from that Illuſtrious Title.</p>

            <p>But as Brave Men muſt expect to be tofs'd when they Steer their courſe againſt the Stream of Fortune, and work againſt Wind and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Almighty God who diſpoſes of all things to the beſt advantage of his beloved Servants has ſuffer'd your noble Family to be notably ſuppreſs'd for a time, and to groan under the heavy weight of great Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Troubles which were, in a manner, equal in number to the afflictions of Holy <hi>Job,</hi>

            <p>'Tis nothing my Lord, for a Man to hold up

            <head>THE Preface.</head>
            <p>WHen God the grand Architect of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe had compleated the vaſt Fabrick of this viſible World and brought out of nothing the Heavens, the Earth, the Seas, and all that is contained within their Prccincts, to exhibit as yet a more remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and a more glorious evidence of his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wiſdom, he did fully reſolve to ſtart out of the Bowels of the Earth with a <hi>Faciamus,</hi> that Microcoſm Man, and give him an aſcendent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to keep all other Creatures in Subjection: He was moulded indeed (as to his Body) not very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to Terrene and Bruit Animals; but as to his Soul, if not equal with the Heavens and heavenly Spirits, at leaſt be was not much inferior to them; for its certain that in the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe thore's nothing worthy any difference (if compar'd with the Soul.) Gold, Silver, Jewels, Pearls, Fire, Moon, Stars, and the very Sun it ſelf, which with its reſplendent Beams brings a ſolemn joy over the
<pb facs="tcp:151886:11"/>whole ſurface of the Earth, are of no Eſtimate in her regard; becauſe that with a Word only God gave them all both their riſe and their office, which was to ſerve Man, and give him all their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. The wonderful Structure of humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is a ſufficient demonſtration of his Excellency, for, where as God had created all other things with a ſole <hi>Dixit,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſays, he muſt come himſelf in perſon to the Creation of this little great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece;
<note place="margin">Gen. 1 26.</note> first he prepares the neceſſary matter for this Conſtruction, then he Breaths into it the Spirit of Life, and after he ſhapes him to the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the primitive and principal Beauty: But to what end? It was, ſays Scripture, with an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual reſolution to devolve upon him an abſolute Supremacy over all the Fiſhes of the Sea,
<note place="margin">Ibid. 28.</note> the Fowls of the Air, and the Beaſts of the Earth; ſo that Man even before he was wafted over from No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to a Being, was openly declar'd Lord of the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, and was after introduc'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, at to his Royal Palace, already furniſh'd with all Neceſſarys and Varieties both for his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence and pleaſure. But you muſt conceive that all this Honour was exhibited to him only upon the account of his participated reſemblance of the Divine Trinity, by which alone he does infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceed all terrene Creatures; ſo that every mortal Man may be deſervedly term'd a petty Divinity (eſpecially when the Grace of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in his Soul.
<note place="margin">Pſal 81.6.</note>) For you muſt know that he does
<pb facs="tcp:151886:12"/>not bear this reſemblance of God in his Body, but within his Soul, becauſe that God is a pure Spirit without any terrene medley, and conſequently can't be perfectly repreſented by any Corporeal Image.</p>
            <p>Its then within the facultys of his Soul that Man bears that reſemblance which gives him an aſcendent power over all other earthly Creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> in his Memory, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and Will, where God is ſtill Preſident, and conſtantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as in his Image and Throne; ſo ſteady, that he is more intimate to the Soul, than ſhe is to her own Subſtance: For the Eternal Father does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh her Memory with his Omnipotency, the Son does illuſtrate her <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding with his Wiſdom, and the Holy Ghoſt does enflame her Will with his Charity; and even as God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt are not Three, but One God in Three diſtinct Perſons; ſo the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is the Soul, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding is the Soul, the Will is the Soul; yet not three Souls, but one in each Body, bearing thoſe three diſtinct Dignitys, wherein the Image and likeneſs of God does ſhine to admiration.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, our Sins may deface this Image with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Souls, however they can't utterly blaſt it; for it is an inherent property in the Wicked as well as in the Juſt; but with this diſtinction, that the Righteous are a lively Image of God, whereas the Wicked are indeed a ſort of an Image of God, but a very obſcure one: however the Divine Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:151886:12"/>is ſo much enamour'd with the Soul he devoted to himſelf with the impreſſion of his Image to be his dearly beloved Spouſe, that he can't be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thence, though the Devil ſhould worm out her conſent to debaſe his Image with all the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity Imaginable.</p>
            <p>Moreover the Soul leans over, and tends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God her Spouſe, with ſo great a weight of natural inclination, that nothing in this World is able to repleniſh her capacity, or ſatisfy her mind but he alone, who of his own Nature is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite good, incircumſcript, and Immenſe. The Dignity and Excellency of the Soul muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be truly great, that all th'alluring objects, and attracting pleaſures of this World can't content her, though they may barter her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for a tract of time, and may perhaps now and then provoke her to their earneſt and hot purſuit, yet they will never make her happy; for when ſhe thinks to poſſeſs them, they fly away, and leave her nothing but an everlaſting diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to have ſettled her affections upon 'em, ſhe is of ſo unſatiable a capacity that all the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe is not able to content her; none but her Heavenly Spouſe can afford her true Conſolation, perfect Tranquillity and Joy without any medley of diſpleaſure. Whatever Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſhe receives within her beſides that of her Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, whatever object ſhe embraces beſides her God, is Seditious, Killing, Vain, and ſavours
<pb facs="tcp:151886:13"/>more of perfect Gall, than of the ſweet Honey of real Comfort.</p>
            <p>As for the Body, who is able to expreſs the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Fabrick thereof; let us conſider how the wiſe and Heavenly Architect has united thoſe two Natures (the Body and Soul) ſo contrary one to th'other in all reſpects, and has link'd them together with ſo ſure a knot of true friendſhip, that they can't be ſeparated without a deal of Violence and Grief. Let us alſo conſider how man (as if he were naturally avers'd to the Earth) looks with his face Heaven-wards, whence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd his Creation and Dignity, and where he does expect his final repoſe. This favour he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from God above all other Creatures as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar evidence of his good Will for him, 'tis alſo a memorial to him of his incumbent duty to God, that by his upright look he might conceive the weighty Obligation he lies under to think always of heavenly things, to tread under foot all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affairs, and never to harbor any vile or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did thoughts in his mind.</p>
            <p>This was the happy State and Condition of Man before his diſmal Fall; for then all his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, his Inclinations and Powers were perfectly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, far from the leaſt motion of any Rebellion, and entirely ſubmitted to th'Empire of the Will. Then Reaſon paid her humble Submiſſion, perfect Obedience, and a compleat Homage to her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor alone; and that perfect ſubmiſſion of Man, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb facs="tcp:151886:13"/>with his faithful concurrence to the Will of God, brought upon him the great Bleſſings of a profound Tranquility, of a grateful Accord, of a firm Peace, of perfect Juſtice, of candid Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, of unſpeakable Purity of heart; ſo that he was a plentiful Source of all good Qualities, of all Vertues, and of all kind of Happineſs. But alas! no ſooner did he expell from his heart the Love and Fear of God, to give ear, and obedience to the malicious dictates of the Infernal Serpent, no ſooner did he forſake his Heavenly Spouſe, to proſtrate himſelf to his Rival and mortal Enemy the Devil, no ſooner was he ſo impiouſly bold as to cancel the Divine Precept at the fatal requeſt of his ſilly Wife, but he was miſerably degraded of all thoſe glorious Prerogatives, and ſuddenly deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from that happy State into an Abyſs of ſuch Evil and Woe, that you would hardly believe him to be the ſame Man. His little Republick, which was before his Rebellion in a profound Peace, fell into ſo great a diſorder, that no two were of one mind. the Will was contrary to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and Reaſon was oppoſite to both; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit repin'd at the Fleſh, the Fleſh rebell'd againſt the Spirit, and gave him no Reſpect or Obedience, becauſe he did the ſame to his Creator. Why ſhould I aggravate his misfortune more than really it was? I will only ſay what is moſt deplorable, and likewiſe most true; all things happen'd to poor Man after his Rebellion quite contrary to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
<pb facs="tcp:151886:14"/>which was to be happy for ever. His Memory, which was (whilst he remain'd in the ſtate of Innocency, and whilſt he tugg'd at the Oar of Obedience) repleniſh'd with all good, and even with the <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> had taken ſo great a draught of Oblivion (not out of the River <hi>Letheos</hi>) but from the Forbidden Apple, that he hardly knew or retain'd any thing but Wickedneſs and Vanity: The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, which was a little before won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully Illuminated with the Knowledge of God, became ſo deſperately involv'd in the darkneſs of a profound Ignorance, that he knew nothing in a manner of his Creators Projects, and was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of his ways. The Will which was all in a Flame of Divine Love, became ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, that like a Blind Mole, ſhe imbrac'd Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood for Truth, Temporal for Eternal, Evil for Good, Carnal for Spiritual, and undervaluing thoſe things which might make her happy for ever, ſhe retain'd nothing of her Innate and Primitive Goodneſs; nay ſhe followed ſuch diſordinate cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as were enough to carry poor man headlong to everlaſting Perdition.</p>
            <p>Reaſon, which as a Monarch, ſhould keep thoſe petty Princes of Man's disjointed Republick in ſubjection, having abdicated his Scepter, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all his Royalties became Tributary, and paid Homage even to his Vaſſals, nay, he ſuffer'd himſelf to be rul'd, and ſeduc'd by thoſe who were
<pb facs="tcp:151886:14"/>created to pay him their conſtant and most humble ſubmiſſion and obedience.</p>
            <p>O ſad Misfortune! What, Man that noble Creature who had from God (as due by his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) an abſolute Supremacy over all terene Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be ſo deluded, and worm'd out of all his Prerogatives by the Devils craft, that he had not the full command of himſelf? He was, heretofore upright both of body and mind; and was look'd upon as a divine Creature; But alas, he was ſoon after reduc'd to that low condition, as he might be very well compar'd (if not to a Brute) at leaſt to a prodigal Child, who had revell'd away all his Birth-right. However, God of his infinite mercy was pleas'd to receive him again into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and after he had waſh'd off his ſinful ſpots with the ſacred Blood of the New Teſtament, he Eſpous'd him to Christ by Faith. This was an extraordinary Grace, and the wonderful product of a most merciful God: It was able to force Man's concurrence (though he were never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful) to love and ſerve him for ever. Never-the-leſs, this miſerable Wretch, has been an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God even from his blooming years, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly forſook Jeſus his gracious Redeemer; nay, he has impudently committed ſo many Adulteries with his Rival, and mortal Adverſary the Devil, as were able to divert him from having any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compaſſion of his miſery.</p>
            <p>What then must be done with Man? must he
<pb facs="tcp:151886:15"/>always perſevere in ſo foul and horrid a Relapſe?
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nunquid qui cadit non adjiciet aliquando ut reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat</hi> Aug.</note> Must not he that falls ſtrive to riſe again? If the Devil had the power and malice to debaſe him to that extream misfortune; has not Jeſus a far greater power to cancel his Contract with that mortal Enemy of mankind, and bring him again into his Flock,
<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, 17, &amp;c.</note> as a ſtraid Sheep? For St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that Sin is not ſo powerful to deſtroy, as the gift of Grace is to repair: If the ſin of one Man has been the fatal occaſion of the loſs of many Souls, the Grace of God through the Merits of one man Jeſus Christ can procure the ſalvation of a far greater number: Man fell by his own fault, but can't riſe again by his own ſtrength; he wants one to help him out of the dunghil of Sin; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a God and man Redeemer to reſtore him with th' effuſion of his most precious Blood to Righteouſneſs, and this was mercifully perform'd to him.</p>
            <p>What remains to compleat the grand work of his Salvation, is, that the ſame Redeemer may be graciouſly pleas'd to touch his heart with a true feeling of his ſincere converſion;
<note place="margin">Jo. 1.5.</note> for he ſays him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that without him we can do nothing; and that if a man abide not in him, he is cast forth as a branch that is withered, and fit for no other uſe than to be cast into the fire, and burnt: But he ſays in the ſame place, that if we abide in him, and his words in us, we may ask what we will, and it ſhall be granted to us. Where upon the Sacred

He alone can breed in us a hearty deteſtation of our ſins, and a firm reſolution to love him above all Creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſt gracious Saviour,</hi> thou art pleas'd to call thy ſelf in ſeveral places of thy holy Writ, our Father, our Brother, our Shepherd, our Spouſe, and haſt graciouſly convers'd with Sinners on Earth in order to their converſion; thou didſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe a Samaritane, and a Harlot too,
<note place="margin">Matth. 23 10.</note> upon the very ſame Subject; thou didſt overthrow a <hi>Saul</hi> to raiſe him up a <hi>Paul;</hi> and which is more,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1.</note> thou didſt make him a Veſſel of Election. Thou haſt forbid us to have, or call any one our Maſter on Earth; for that thou alone art our Maſter; and therefore I preſume to call thee our Divine Maſter, and to honour this Book with that ſpecious Title of <hi>Academy,</hi> or <hi>School of Vertue,</hi> becauſe what it contains, is either thy Doctrine, or grounded at leaſt upon the ſolid foundation of thy Eternal Vereties. The moſt that I can glory of in this Work, is to be thy unworthy Miniſter, and Steward to make known thy ſacred Will, and thy divine Myſterys to thy People,
<pb facs="tcp:151886:16"/>which I have perform'd to the utmoſt of my Endeavours; for here the Chriſtian Reader ſhall find ſuch deep Conſiderations, and powerful Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as will divert him from hankering after even the ſmalleſt Vices: They will tear all his ill habits up by the roots, that they may never ſhoot again, and will extricate his poor heart out of all the ſtraights that commonly enſue a criminal and guilty Conſcience. They will teize a man (though never ſo cold in Devotion) to graſp at all manner of Mortifications to ſatisfy for his ſins, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the juſt Indignation of the Divine Juſtice. They will deliver us from all blindneſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous Errors, enriching our darkneſs with light, and reſtoring all troubled ſouls to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found peace. They will hinder us from deſcanting upon other Mens lives and manners. They will make remote Forreigners, near Neighbours, and cement them in Chriſtian Charity. They will bring us to pry into what ill abounds in our own hearts, and find there work enough to imploy our pragmatical Spleen upon, without hunting after the ſins and imperfections of others. They will bring Strangers to God's acquaintance, diſſolve all diſcords. and make the Devil to deſpair of his aim, which is to blow the helliſh fire of a perpetual diſſention into our ſouls. They will conclude a League of everlaſting Peace with God, and (if we believe St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>) they are the complement of a happy life, and th'only immortal thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb facs="tcp:151886:16"/>to Mortals. And no wonder, being that God himſelf is the first, and principal Author of this heavenly Exerciſe: For as ſoon as he had given the Law to his People,
<note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> He declar'd it was his will and pleaſure it ſhould be the worthy Subject of their ſerious and conſtant Meditation, fix my words, ſays he, in your hearts, and in your minds; have them in your hands, and before your eyes, teach them to your Children,

            <p>THat no exteriour Agent without th' interiour word of God is able to work the Converſion of a Sinner, C. <hi>Pag. 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That God is more free to impart his Graces and Favours to Sinners than they are ſollicitous to improve them. C. <hi>p. 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manifold Obſtacles which hinder the Sinners Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and how strong and numerous are th'allurements to Sin, C. <hi>p. 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The motives to Vertue are far more preſſing and more in number, C. <hi>p. 11.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>That Man can't ſo eaſily attain to Divine Love by reaſon of the manifold and great oppoſitions which are betwixt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and grace. C. <hi>p. 32.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The examples of Chriſt, and of his beloved Apostles on Earth, together with Gods formal Precept, and th'aſſured promiſe of his grace; lays a weighty obligation on all men to lead a Vertuous and Godly Life, C. <hi>p. 42.</hi>

            </p>

            <pb facs="tcp:151886:17"/>

            </p>
            <p>The greatneſs of Gods Love for Man is a most preſſing motive to a ſorrowful contrition, M. <hi>p 67.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The means which God was pleas'd to take in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem Mankind is another preſſing motive to a ſorrowful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, M. <hi>p. 71.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Chriſt has ſuffer'd from his Cradle to the Croſs was only for the love of Man, M. <hi>p. 74.</hi>

            <p>The benefit of our Juſtification exceeds that of our Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Redemption, M. <hi>p. 103.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151886:18"/>
            <p>The certainty of Death, and th'uncertainty of the hour of Death with the ſeveral and dreadful circumstances thereof is a most preſſing motive to detest Sin, M. <hi>p. 106.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The particular Judgment which is given of the Soul at her departing the Body, M. <hi>p. 114.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Of the most strict account which will be taken of the Soul in this particular Judgment, M. <hi>p. 126.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How remote is the Judgment of God from that of Man, and of the ſeverity of his Chastiſements even in this Life, by which we may eaſily conceive th'unſpeakable rigour of his puniſhments in th'other, M. <hi>p. 133.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Torments which the Damn'd ſuffer in Hell, M. <hi>p. 140.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Glory of Heaven, in what it conſiſts, of its great esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and what we ought to ſuffer for the everlaſting purchaſe thereof, M. <hi>p. 148.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of th'everlaſting happineſs of the Saints in Heaven, and of their glorious Prerogatives, M. <hi>p. 162.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The little value that Chriſtians ſet upon Vertue, and how their diſſolutions ſurpaſs the debauchery even of the worſt of Heathens, M. <hi>p. 173.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Godly feelings and Heroick exploits of Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers will certainly confound the Chriſtians in the Day of Judgment, M. <hi>p. 188.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of Hell, and of th'unſpeakable and various Torments which the Damn'd ſhall ſuffer there for an Eternity, M. <hi>p. 201</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the ſeverity of Gods Justice, the rage and malice of the Devils, and the horrid confuſion of the Damn'd, occaſion'd by the full Knowledge of their Vanities, main Folly and wilful neglect of their Salvation, M. <hi>p. 217.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151886:18"/>
            <p>The wonderful Austerities of Gods Servants as well in the Old as in the New Teſtament in order to avoid the Torments of Hell will be a main confuſion to ſuch Christians as live de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly in this World, M. <hi>p. 226.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If men be ſo outragiouſly cruel one to th'other, how exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive cruel muſt the Devil be to the Damn'd in Hell being a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemy to all mankind even from the Creation, M. <hi>p. 234.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An habitual Sinner that puts off his Converſion to the hour of Death in expectation of a good <hi>Peccavi</hi> lies under a moral impoſſibility to be ſav'd, M. <hi>p. 248.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Love of God ſhould repleniſh our hearts to that degree to leave no place for any terrene or carnal affection, M. <hi>p. 266.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An ample deſcription of th'ingratitude, inconstancy, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, cruelty, and vanity of the World, with ſeveral preſidents relating thereunto, M. <hi>p. 278.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lust of the Fleſh with its fatal attendance and branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, are most abominable in themſelves, moſt odious to God, and the moſt deſtructive enemies of our Souls, M. <hi>p. 293.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Th'only thing that the Nobility ſhould value themſelves upon is Vertue, how vain is the Wiſdom of the World? Of Corporal Beauty and Rich Apparel, and how th'one as well as th'other has been the ruine of many Millions of Souls, M. <hi>p. 310.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the State of Poverty is far more advantageous to the Soul than that of Riches, though it may not be ſo pleaſant to the mind, which is never content, M. <hi>p. 327.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Charming expreſſions of Christ, and the ſeveral em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments he takes upon himſelf in order to ſave our Souls are able to withdraw all our ſcatter'd affections from the World, and ſettle them upon him alone, M. <hi>p. 346.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151886:19"/>
            <p>That the World is both a Cheat and a Lyar, for his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ars falſe, his Honours are vain, his Pleaſures are Poyſon, and his Treaſures are Soul-Killing Thorns, <hi>M. p. 368.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they who after all Gods ſweet Inſpirations, loving Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and gracious Admonitions, do not love him recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſhall be in danger of eternal Deſtruction, <hi>M. p. 384.</hi>

Our frailty is ſo great that it cannot be paralel'd in any other creature of whatever State or Condition; our vanity is no leſs, if not ſurpaſſing our frailty. What ſhall ſuch a poor Creature do amidſt ſo ſtrong and ſo many allurements to ſin; of one ſide the world ſollicites him to be of his faction, &amp; taſt of his pleaſures at will, the Fleſh inclines him another way, the Devil perſwades him to ſlight his own proper intereſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be happy eternally by adhering to his Creator, and to ſide with him againſt God. Moreover he ſeeth that the wicked are the Darlings of Fortune, and have all earthly pleaſures at command, but he beholds the righteous and faithful followers of God groaning under the weighty burthen of great tribulations; nay, he verily thinks thee to look on the wicked with a pleaſing aſpect, and to frown on the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151886:24"/>Juſt; what confirms him in this opinion, is, the aſſurance thou giveſt them of pardon, whenever they ſhall with true repentance come to thee: this, they take as an incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for ſinners to continue their licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and wicked life; and even ſo it falls out with many; they ſpend their youth in all manner of unlawful pleaſures, nay, they will intrench upon old age, rather then deſiſt their long continued diſorders; yet when by thy Decree a violent Sickneſs ſeizeth them and confines them to their bed, then they continually implore thee for mercy; <hi>Peccavi</hi> is their deplorable ditty, which they inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly repeat till they expire; muſt we not piouſly believe that ſuch are ſaved? notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the long <hi>Series</hi> of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſins; yes, and this conſideration holds us in our rambling &amp; vicious humours; and likewiſe, it expells all thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canting from our mind; the frequent Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of thy mercy exhibited to far more wicked livers, retards our converſion; ſo doth the conceit of that narrow and craggy Paſſage, which (as thou ſayſt) can only lead us to Heaven: Moreover why ſhould we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that heavy yoke upon our younger days, ſeeing that Heaven is promiſed to us at any time, when we ſhall cry <hi>Peccavi,</hi> tho' we ſhould omit it, even to our decrepid Age.</p>

               <p>When I read in thy holy Writ, and hear what the learned Doctors of thy Church ſay of the love of God, I conceive an ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to partake in ſome meaſure thereof; for to pretend to the full perfection of it, is a thing beyond my reach, unleſs thou giveſt thy helping hand to my poor endeavours. 'Tis abſolutely the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi>

                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.</note> that only can make the burdenſome, &amp; weighty things light; that can bear equally all unequal things, that can carry a burden without any toil; that can make ſweet and pleaſant, what of its own nature is bitter, and uneaſy. The love of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151886:30"/>God preſſeth men on to perform great and heroick actions; and does excite them to aime always at what is moſt perfect, and pleaſing to his divine Majeſty. Love is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver content to fix its tabernacle on earth, nor to be concern'd with any terrene object; it muſt have a more noble Subject to entertain its flames: It muſt be totally free, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely a ſtranger to all worldly affections, leſt they ſhould diminiſh its Luſtre, &amp; force it out of its natural Centure, to lodge with our blinde and unruly paſſions.</p>
               <p>There's nothing more ſweet, and attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive then the love of God, nothing more active and ſtrong; nothing more eminent and generous, nothing can exceed it in lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, extent and altitude, there is nothing more pleaſant and affable; <hi>In fine,</hi> there is nothing in Heaven, or on Earth that can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell it in goodneſs, in beauty or perfection, and why? becauſe it doth proceed from God, &amp; that it cann't repoſe in any created thing, but in God alone. A divine Lover will fly, run &amp; rejoyce, tho' he were condemn'd to lodge with <hi>Daniel</hi> among the hungry, &amp; devouring Lyons. He is free, and enjoys his liberty tho' he were in chains, and loaden with Irons as another <hi>Manaſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He gives with St. <hi>Francis,</hi> All for All; and findes his whole delight and comfort in that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151886:30"/>very All, which he makes choice of; And in that one ſupreme All the fountain-head of all goodneſs, he ſweetly repoſeth with the Spouſe void of diſturbance.</p>
               <p>A divine Lover never looks upon the gifts, tho' never ſo excellent, but has his eyes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fix'd upon the giver, neither is he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with what graces and favours he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from God, but will ſtrive to purchaſe more, tho' it were even with the loſs of his ſweet life. For Love admits of no bounds, &amp; its flames will riſe above all limitation and meaſure. It feels no weight, values no labour, invents new ways of mortifications, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes affects to ſuffer for his beloved, more then fleſh and blood is able to bear. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Lover will not regard impoſſibilities, for he thinks that all the Auſterities, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours imaginable are both lawful and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, he is able therefore in his own ardent and elevated conceit, to vanquiſh all difficultys, and does indeed perform more then can be expected from Nature alone; <hi>In fine,</hi> his good will never fails him, tho' his body ſhould ly half dead upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Love is watchful; if Sleeping it's always awake, if harraſs'd it's never weary, in dangers it's never fearful, when frightned it's never troubled, but even as a fierce blaze, and a lively flame; it paſſes by all ſuch events,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:151886:31"/>and mounts up towards the very throne of God, where it lies ſafe from all diſaſters, &amp; evil accidents. This language perhaps is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to many; but he who really loves God, will eaſily underſtand it. The fervent deſire alone of a Seraphick Soul makes a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing noiſe in the hearing of God;

Thou ſpeakeſt admirably of the love of God, but thou canſt not perceive the motions and operations thereof within thy own heart, by reaſon of its predominate inclinations to the carnal, and fading objects of the world. Therefore,
<note place="margin">Diliges Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum Deum tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ex to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to corde tuo. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37.</note> for thy better underſtanding, I will in the firſt place tell thee, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and chief Command, is to love God with thy whole heart. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that to be a proficient, is to obtain a farther increaſe, as well in all virtues, as in the Seven gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that without Charity, nothing can be meritorious, no, nor accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that Charity, of all
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151886:32"/>other virtues, is the moſt worthy; becauſe it is the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> the Life, the Queen, the firſt beginning, and end of them all; and that no other virtue, or thing whatever, can ſo efficaciouſly move a Soul to all acts of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor ſo ſpeedily and powerfully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw her from ſin, and vicious habits, as the Love of God. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> becauſe the Intuitive viſion of God, (which is th' eſſential reward of the Bleſſed) has a perfect reference to the higheſt degree, and ſublimeſt perfection of Charity.</p>
               <p>Now to give thee a perfect demonſtration of thy own weakneſs, and to let thee know how much thou art a ſtranger to the love of God; I muſt tell thee that this heavenly Charity, is a moſt reſplendent and glorious Pearl; a moſt precious and charming gem; a moſt pure and noble Balm; a moſt ſweet and fragrant herb; and conſequently does require a moſt clean and ſpotleſs reſidence, and a Seat adorn'd with all the rareſt &amp; moſt precious ornaments, that can be imagin'd; I mean a Soul cleans'd from all mortal ſpots, deck'd with all moral virtues, throughly lin'd with the gifts of the Holy-Ghoſt, and ſupported on each ſide with the Strong pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of a firm and conſtant Hope, and Faith.</p>
               <p>I muſt tell thee likewiſe of the degrees of Charity, the firſt of them is infus'd into the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:151886:33"/>Soul by her Baptiſmal grace, and this is not to be hid idlely, but to be improv'd with a great deal of care, and brought to its ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate perfection; O what a deal of care is to be taken in ſo great an enterprize the minde muſt be kept pure and clean, free from all mortal ſpots, and beautifi'd with all the virtues and gifts aforeſaid (as far as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and ſtate of a new beginner will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.) 'Tis an incumbent duty on all Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals that are lodg'd within this inferiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Charity, to wiſh ardently for the ſight ond perfect injoyment of the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> to labour hardly for an utter extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of all their imperfections and vicious habits; to reclaim and utterly ſubdue their unruly paſſions; to be conſtantly imploy'd in the painful exerciſe and worthy works of Pennance; to keep their mindes from all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions in prayers; to reform the exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our man, and keep it ſtill in a modeſt &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent poſture in all their communications and conferences with God.

All theſe Ingredients, I muſt confeſs, are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary bitter, and irkſome to thy corrupt nature, however thou muſt endeavour with all thy might to ſwallow down thoſe ill-pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat-pleaſing Pills, not for once, but ſo often, until thou doſt acquire a habit of uſing them without any difficulty, and then thou ſhalt perceive the great benefit thy Soul will reap by the conſtant practiſe of ſo divine a remedy. Then thou wilt without any compulſion or contradiction from either the outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, freely and conſtantly bewail thy former ſinful life; thou wilt earneſtly dive into the moſt reclus'd and hidden corners of thy heart, to finde out therein what may be diſpleaſing to God, with a reſolution either to ſmother them in their cradle by a contrite Confeſſion, or to drown them all in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tears of a ſorrowful repentance. Thy dayly entertainment will be to meditate on my bloudy Paſſion, to think often of the dreadful day of Judgment, of Death, of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151886:34"/>everlaſting pains of Hell, and of the many favours and graces which thou haſt received at the moſt liberal hands of thy moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God; firmly grounding thy ſelf in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found humility, in patience, in a full reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Gods Decrees, in the fear and love of thy dearly beloved Maker. After this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly exerciſe, thou art to proceed to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſe in virtue, to a more accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd Charity, to Spiritual exerciſes, and to devout meditations; thereby to fix thy heart in God alone, and to avoid Idleneſs which is the ſeat of iniquity; thou muſt give ſome time to thy Studys, ſome to Prayer, ſome to writing, ſome to the practiſe of charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deeds, as viſiting the Sick, relieving Priſoners, comforting the Poor, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, as well with thy good advices, as with a ſhare of thy ſubſtance, but in all thy actions be ſure to have thy mind always fix'd upon God, for whoſe ſake alone thou muſt begin, go on, and end all thy good works; thou muſt often raiſe up thy thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, that happy reſidence, for the enjoying of which thou wert created, and be never wearied with labour; or think the time long e're you gain it. All this belongs to the illuminative life, to the State of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients, to the degree of purifying virtues, and to thoſe private friends that do ſweetly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151886:34"/>adhere unto their God, and embrace him with arms of Charity.</p>
               <p>Being perfectly grounded in this kinde of life, thou muſt aſcend to a higher School, where thou art to begin the rudiments of the perfective and unitive life; which are, pure contemplations, moſt ardent, moſt ſweet, and moſt loving Embraces of thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; the inſeparable and continual unions with thy Spouſe; the practice of miſtical Theology; a Transformation into God; Raptures, Extaſies, Acts of heroical virtue; the immoveable quietneſs, and peace of the minde in God; then by a ſupreme degree of the gift of Wiſdom, thou art made, as it were, one of Gods Secretarys, and Cabinet-Councel, ſo that being come to this height, thou art made privy to all the hidden myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his eternal Wiſdom, and rais'd to that pitch of honour, as to lodge him ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within thy breaſt.</p>
               <p>Then thou ſhalt ſincerely, and ſweetly contemplate with a clear underſtanding what are of Faith, and the reaſons for believing them. Thou ſhalt behold the glory, the Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the inbred Communication, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual intuition, dilection, fruition, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conſiſtance of the ever Bleſſed and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious Trinity. Then all creatures, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to the infinite, and incomprehenſible
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:151886:35"/>Majeſty of God, will appear to thee as Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires, nay, even as nothing. <hi>In fine,</hi> then will all thy comfort, all thy pleaſure, all thy ſatisfaction and affection be lodg'd after a moſt ſolid manner in thy God alone.

               <p>THy words o' Lord, are as dreadfull to me, as Thunder and lightning are to the timorous and pregnant Hinde. Thy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is ſo ſublime, and ſurpaſſeth ſo much my underſtanding, that I cannot conceive it. Doſt thou think that man in his frail, and mortal fleſh can lead the life of an Angel? that a Pilgrim can pretend to the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Bleſſed? or that he can live on earth ſo conformable to the Rules and Rites of the Saints in Heaven. What man alive can paſs over his mortal days without Sin. Thou know'ſt that there's nothing more unſettled, and more inconſtant then the minde of man, and wilt thou require of him, as an incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent duty, to be always in contemplation of heavenly things, to have his thoughts always fix'd upon thee, to ſtand at all hours in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:151886:35"/>preſence of God, and never to have the leaſt correſpondence with the world, or with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny earthly affairs? I know that with the powerful aſſiſtance of thy Grace, he might eaſily comply with thy will in all theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions; and I know likewiſe that Nature will never bear the rigour of ſuch weighty impoſitions, ſo contrary to her inbred incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; for the motions of Grace and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are directly oppoſit in operations; both tend to good, but the good that one aimes at, is a great evil to the other, ſo that many may be deceived in their election of this, or that other good. Grace walks on innocently, and without any diſguiſe; ſhe is ignorant of all Quibbles, and fallacies, ſhe declines from all things that bear, even the ſhaddow of evil, &amp; does all her actions purely for the love of God, whom ſhe owns to be her bountiful head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, Prototype, &amp; final end; this is very good in her thoughts; yet Nature looks upon it to be quite contrary, for ſhe is ſubtil, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, alluring, and with her charms, ſhe draws, inſnares, and deceives many; as for her laſt end, ſhe will admit of none, but of ſelf-intereſt. Grace delights to mortify and pull down the Fleſh, to curb, and utterly ſuppreſs all the Inſurrections and Rebellious motions of the old man, to reſiſt all ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhe loves to be kept under, to be Croſs'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:151886:36"/>in her inclinations, to be depriv'd of her proper will, and bar'd of her liberty; to be under correction, rather then have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of others; to be always ſubmiſſive to God, and for his ſake to become an humble Servant, and even a ſlave to all mankind; but Nature is directly contrary in her tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſhe is deſirous of all manner of pleaſure, and has an abhorrence for mortification, and hates to be curb'd, to be oppreſs'd, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd from her inclinations, ſhe will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, rather then obey; for ſhe deteſts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and will not (if ſhe can poſſibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it) ſubmit her ſelf to any higher Power.</p>
               <p>Grace will rather chooſe to do what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to others, then what is profitable and convenient for her ſelf; but nature will labour for her own advantage, and if ſhe does any ſervice to others ſhe will expect to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly rewarded. Grace will return faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully all honour and glory to God (as being the Soveraign alone deſerving of it) but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will thirſt after honours and reverence, after Supremacy and dignitys, and thinks that Cap and Knee is for her alone. Grace will rejoyce to be debaſs'd, and to ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and injuries for the name of Jeſus, but Nature abhors the very thoughts of ſuch ſufferings, and will uſe all means poſſible ſhe can to avoid them. Grace cannot endure to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:151886:36"/>be idle, but ever thirſts after action, but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo well pleas'd with eaſe, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the conceit alone of toil, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, is to her as odious, as the Plague it ſelf. Grace delights in low and ſordid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and will not repine at a courſe and thredbare garment; but Nature does place her comfort, and whole ſatisfaction in curious and coſtly Apparel, &amp; will be ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſturb'd, when humbled and brought to any mean exerciſe. Grace is abſolutely for heavenly things, ſhe paſſes by the temporal, ſhe values not their loſs, neither is ſhe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd at evil accidents: becauſe ſhe hath placed all her treaſure and pleaſure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where nothing can ſuffer any loſs or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, but Nature has all her attention to temporal things, puts all her ſatisfaction in Earthly wealth, is ſad for the loſs of them, and cannot bear the leaſt affront or injury.</p>
               <p>Grace is piouſly inclin'd, and free to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate her favours to all, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, but Nature is greedy, and covetous, ſhe is wholly for proper and private intereſt; ſhe cannot ſee the way to the poor mans houſe, but ſhe is all eyes to finde out the rich and liberal; ſhe is not willing to ſtretch her hand to the needy, but ſhe is pleaſant when ſhe is touch'd in the hand with a weighty gift. Grace draws all Creatures to God, not for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151886:37"/>her own Intereſt, for ſhe is an abſolute Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the World, ſhe abhors all ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, excurſions are odious to her, and bluſhes to appear in publick; but Nature's delight, &amp; greateſt pleaſure is to be converſant with the Creatures, to pamper her own fleſh, to diſcourſe of vain and idle matters, and if a heavy word caſually fall in by the by of a neighbour,
<note place="margin">Quod ti bi non vis fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri alteri non fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris.</note> ſhe will inlarge upon it, contrary to that fundamental rule, of her own proper and poſitive law, what you would not be done to, don't do it to another.</p>
               <p>Grace ſeeks for her comfort in God alone, and finds in that <hi>Summum bonum</hi> more fatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and pleaſure, then in all viſible and delightful objects of this world. Grace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects no temporal reward for what favours ſhe exhibits, for God alone is her retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of all temporal neceſſaries, ſhe covets none, but what may exactly help her to the acquiſition of eternal Bliſs; but Nature does all her actions for lucre of future gain; for ſhe can do nothing <hi>gratis,</hi> no, ſhe muſt have a more ample, or at leaſt an equal return for her work, &amp; that muſt be paid her down in <hi>Specie;</hi> if that fails her, ſhe will expect a large commendation, or the caſt of a conſiderable favour on occaſion.</p>
               <p>Grace loves even her mortal enemies, ſhe becomes not proud of her rich, and well-qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:151886:37"/>friends, ſhe is nothing extoll'd with the height of her extraction, and noble blood of her Anceſtors, if virtue do not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them; ſhe favours more the poor, then ſhe does the rich; and has more compaſſion of the innocent Criminal, then of the Potent Malefactor; ſhe is a friend to truth, and an enemy to falſhood; ſhe is never weary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the good to a more eminent perfection, and to become the faithful followers of their gracious Redeemer; but Nature is overjoy'd to ſee her ſelf amongſt an abundance of friends, and relations, ſhe glories in her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble extraction, and ſpeaks highly of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of her family; ſhe is compleſant to the powerful, flatters the Rich, applands her fellows in Iniquity, and puſhes them on to a further acquiſition of vice, ſhe makes virtue to ſeem rediculous to them, that ſhe may the eaſier have a full Empire in their hearts, and ſit the ſafer in her throne. Grace will be nothing ſurpriz'd to ſee her ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from a high and plentiful State, to a low and indigent condition; but Nature will grumble, repine, and ſnarl at Gods Providence for ſo great, and ſo unexpected a downfal.</p>
               <p>Grace attributes all goodneſs to God, as being the chief Source, and offspring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhe will brag of no good, that ſhe can
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:151886:38"/>do of her ſelf; ſhe is content with the bare notion of Gods packet-bearer, that brings his Commiſſions from Heaven, to the wicked and rebellious of the World, and to ſollicite them, to a new and ſpeedy reform, both of their lives and manners; ſhe is nothing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant, nothing clamorous, or contentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, but has her underſtanding, &amp; ſenſes ſubmiſſive to the eternal Wiſdom's examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, direction, and conduct; but Nature covets to be inform'd of all Secrets, to know all novelties, to be much abroad, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent where the greateſt reſort is, her ſenſes muſt all be at hot work, ſhe muſt know all people, and all muſt be acquainted with her; Grace is quite contrary in her diſpoſition; ſhe is for a more ſublime imployment: ſhe values not thoſe Trifles, that Nature is ſo enamour'd with, neither is ſhe curious to know thoſe ſilly intrigues, and fooliſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of the World, becauſe they are all the products of a long ſtanding corruption, and therefore they cannot be grateful to her, for ſhe will have us not to buſy our ſenſes with them; but to avoid all manner of oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and vain complacency, nay ſhe will have us abſcond in all humility, what is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commendable, and worthy of all mens ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, ſhe is much of the nature of a Bee that gathers hony out of the moſt poiſonous
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:151886:38"/>herbs, if ſhe ſees any thing praiſe-worthy in men (tho' never ſo wicked) ſhe gathers it, into her hony-comb, and conſidering it to be a participation of Gods goodneſs, ſhe makes an oblation of it to his greater honour and glory: ſhe abhors that her ſelf, or any good work ſhe does, ſhould be publiſh'd, or applauded, but that the Almighty ſhould be ever bleſs'd in all his gifts; and ſince we have nothing of our own that can be call'd good, if any good work we do, God muſt be the Promoter of it, conſequently Grace will have us to refer it to him alone, and not boaſt of it, as of our own production.</p>
               <p>'Tis this great diſtance betwixt Nature &amp; Grace, and their main oppoſition in matter of Government, that makes me, in a manner deſpair of ever getting the better of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd nature, prone to evil, even from her Cradle; for ſhe had her downfal by <hi>Adam's</hi> Tranſgreſſion, and the puniſhment thereof by a Decree from Heaven, was intail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all her Poſterity, ſo that Nature, which (as firſt created) walk'd uprightly in all her ways, became vicious by his ſin, and to that degree, that all her motions are bent to evil, and is her ſelf ſo blinde, that ſhe leads her poor Pupils, I mean the poor Souls that are Lodg'd within her precincts, into the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice of eternal Damnation.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:151886:39"/>
               <p>The little ſtrength that remain'd in her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this fatal overthrow, may be very well compar'd to a ſmall ſparkle, that lies glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Cinders, and this I call natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſon, which is altogether overclouded, notwithſtanding ſhe can diſcern what is true, and what is falſe; what is good, and what is evil; but has not the power to full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all that ſhe approves, for ſhe is both ſick, and crazy, as well in all her Senſes, as in all her affections.</p>

I know likewiſe the way to perfection, and do ſee full well what I ought to do for to attain it, but alas! I am ſo preſs'd down with the weight of of my corruptions, that I am not able to climb towards it. So that I ſee clearly how neceſſary is thy Grace, to begin a good work, to go on with the ſame, and to bring it to a compleat end; for without thy Grace I can perform nothing, but I ſhall be able to do all, if I be aſſiſted with the ſame.

               <p>The gifts of Nature are common, as well to the wicked, as to the Juſt; but Grace is the proper Prerogative of the Elect, which gives them an aſſured title to life everlaſting.

He is within one degree of Heaven it ſelf, and yet he is not Satisfied, he would fain have Heaven for his inheritance, and the glory of Saints for his Patrimony, without any further trouble.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:151886:46"/>This and many more Inſtances I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, of the great tenderneſs that God has for man, ſo that none who is truly a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, has the leaſt ground to doubt, but that he, and his only and dearly beloved Son al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, who has ſuffer'd ſo much for men, and gave even his very Life to ſave them from Death everlaſting, will be ready, not only to hear their prayers at all times, but alſo moſt free, to comply with their requeſt.</p>
               <p>But I muſt give thee to underſtand that prayer is an act of virtue, and therfore it's call'd, <hi>Latria,</hi> ſo that it is not every petition that can be rightly term'd a prayer, for this is an humble demand of decent and neceſſary things to Salvation. As thou art oblig'd to be firmly fix'd in the conſtant practice of other virtues, thou muſt be the ſame in prayer, thou muſt never give over, but ſtill continue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame ſubject with God. And withal if thou doſt expect to be heard, and to obtain the effects of thy prayer from him, thou muſt add the following councel to my former, that is, utterly to break off with vice, and fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a virtuous life. For what a ridiculous thing it is to think, that God will remit thee thy Sins, whilſt thou art reſolv'd, not to forſake them, but rather to increaſe them dayly. To hope for any mercy at his hands, whom thou doſt diſhonour, provoke and offend hourly,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:151886:46"/>what doſt thou think of it? is it not to laugh at the Almighty, and to ridicule the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent? If thou hadſt dealt ſo with a terene King, or with one of an inferiour degree, certainly he would be highly diſpleas'd with thee, and take it as a great affront, that thou ſhouldſt crave his pardon for the wrong thou haſt done him, and which thou art reſolv'd not to repent; how much more ſhould the God of infinite Juſtice, the Lord of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Majeſty, and the Judge of illuminate Wiſdom, be incens'd againſt a poor, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed creature, that would go ſo bare-fac'd to affront him.</p>
               <p>By what is ſaid thou mayſt underſtand that the duty of a well-meaning Orator, is firſt to be inwardly griev'd to have ever offended his God, ſecondly to make him condign ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for all his paſt offences, thirdly to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe firmly not only to avoid Sin, but alſo the occaſion which may bring him to it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this worthy preparation, he then muſt make a ſorrowful, entire, and ſincere confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all his Sins, to his ſpiritual Father, &amp; fulfill exactly what ſatisfaction he ſhall enjoyn him. If thou doſt perform this, and live e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after according to theſe dictates, thou ſhalt undoubtedly obtain from God the effect of thy prayer, let it be what thou wilt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the remiſſion of thy ſins, or a further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:151886:47"/>of Grace, or any other rational requeſt. I muſt confeſs, that he does ſometimes, even as a wiſe and provident Father, delay the performance thereof, but it is to try, the faith, and patience of his Orators, and to exerciſe his Elect, even the moſt holy among them, that they may be worthy Preſidents to others; or it is to practiſe their virtue and perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to his holy will, in order to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them with a more eminent degree of glory.</p>

'Tis alſo a deteſtation, which is hatred, and an averſion which one has to Sin, when he conſiders it to be a moſt wicked thing, a mortal enemy to God, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to his own Salvation. But there muſt be a firm reſolution made to avoid Sin for the future, and likewiſe the occaſion which leads to it, this is a neceſſary conſequence of that grief &amp; hatred of ſin; for if thou be'ſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſorry for the evil committed; and doſt truly deteſt it, thou wilt alſo have a will to avoid it, if not, 'tis moſt evident, that thou

Both Scripture and Reaſon does manifeſt this truth, that this ſorrow for thy Sins muſt be lodg'd in thy heart, and as thy will was the principal cauſe of thy Sin, ſo it muſt be the chief actor in thy ſorrow. Thy heart muſt renounce the evil which it has willfully committed, and deteſt the ſin which it had formerly affected.</p>
               <p>Thy Grief muſt iſſue from a ſupernatural
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:151886:50"/>motive, and the reaſon of it is, that an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on purely natural cannot be a condign ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to me, for thy mortal tranſgreſſion of my poſitive commandment, thou mayſt ſee by the ſorrow of <hi>Saul,</hi> who did not grieve for his ſin, but for the loſs of his Kingdom, which God had reſolv'd to take from him, to give it to a more faithful, and obedient ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. <hi>Antiochus's</hi> ſorrow was grounded upon the like motive; for he did not weep for his ſins, but by reaſon of his great misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. Afflictions may indeed ſtir up a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to return to God, but they ſhall never be able to reclaim him from his wickedneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my Grace. To obtain which he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt his ſins, becauſe they are infinitely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to God, and a great obſtacle to his own Salvation; theſe are ſupernatural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, without which thy contrition will ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify nothing in order to receive the grace of God.</p>
               <p>Thy grief muſt be alſo ſovereign, that is moſt powerful. And the reaſon for it is, that it's not enough to deteſt Sin upon a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural motive, but that this motive muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verrule all other, that come into thy minde, and rather deteſt ſin by reaſon of the damage it brings to thy Salvation, or the injury done to God thereby, then for any natural evils which it may produce, and be ready to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

The reaſon of it is, that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sins cannot be remitted, but totally, not one without the reſt, for if thou ſhouldſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an affection for one mortal Sin, tho' thou ſhouldſt have an abhorrence againſt all the reſt, thou art ſtill an enemy to God, and a worthy object of his higheſt diſpleaſure.

I acknowledge now the great evil which I have done; now I ſee the grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Sins, now I ſee how few have that true and perfect contrition which is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation; ſeeing they relapſe into their habitual offences ſo ſoon; and ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for had they that great ſorrow for their Sins, they would be certainly more vigilant to avoid them, then to prevent the greateſt of all misfortunes.</p>
               <p>They would be alſo more eager to ſet a ſtop to the dangerous currant of venial Sins, ſince they are the preludes of a vicious habit, and that by degrees they bring us to make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of mortals; for they do notably dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the lights of our underſtanding, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our minde is overclouded by them; our heart over-rul'd; the ſtrength of grace, and the vigour of virtue made weaker, our Soul diſorder'd, and laid open to all evil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, they don't deſtroy ſanctifying grace; but they diſpoſe us very much to loſe it. All together they don't make a mortal ſin,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:151886:52"/>but they diſpoſe the Soul to fall into it. They don't directly cauſe death; but they create thoſe ſpiritual weakneſſes, &amp; maladies which bring death with them. In a word, tho' ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Sins don't break the league and unity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and the Soul, which is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that happy foundation of grace, yet inperceptably they diminiſh it, and by this diminution Charity is weaken'd in us, and God by degrees withdraws from us, the chief favours of his aſſiſtance in all our ſpiritual neceſſities; conſequently having leſs ſtrength, we fall more eaſily into mortal Sin, when we are aſſaulted by any temptation.</p>
               <p>By this I may eaſily conclude, that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is careleſs to avoid venial ſins, has not a ſufficient abhorrence of mortals, for there is nothing ſo venial but may be, through an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate complacency, diſſolution, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, become of the number of mortals, and perhaps of the moſt capital Sins.

               <p>KNow then, that after I had taken man out of the bowells of the Earth with a <hi>Faciamnus,</hi> and created him, to my own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and likeneſs; in order to make him ſole Lord and abſolute Monarch of the whole Univerſe, with full power to take and taſt of all things that a moſt pleaſant paradiſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:151886:53"/>could afford, (the fruit of Life only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed). He the ungratefull and rebellious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſidering the great advantage of his condition, and the greatneſs of his dignity, which ſhould be to him a ſufficient motive to love, obey, reſpect and praiſe me for ever; took thence occaſion to mutiny, rebell and deſert me, and enter into a league againſt me with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> whom I had a little before expell'd Heaven for his thoughts of Pride &amp; Ambition; and who, from that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made a vow to deface and deſtroy my Picture, being that he could not annoy my Perſon. This ſo heinous an offence, deſerv'd he ſhould be immediately commanded out of that Terreſtrial Paradiſe, where he was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and liv'd like a petty Prince, and where he had all other creatures, even the moſt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious among them, at his beck, to do with them as he thought fit.

               <p>He was therefore turn'd off as a vagabond, caſt into exile, and made liable to ſuffer the puniſhment, even of the damn'd, for as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an aſſociate to the Devil in Sin, 'twas fit he ſhould be his companion in torment. Thou haſt heard of my Judgement inflicted on <hi>Gehazi</hi> my Prophets ſervant, and how, for taking <hi>Naaman's</hi> mony and cloths, for the cure of his Leproſy; I order'd that for his covetous tranſgreſſion, both he and all his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:151886:53"/>generation to the worlds end, ſhould ſhare in his Leproſy, as he did in his garments. Even ſo have I decreed againſt man, who had ſo much affected <hi>Lucifers</hi> Pride and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, that he ſhould be likewiſe infected with his Leproſy, and as he was obedient to his ſuggeſtions, he ſhould partake of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments alſo.

               <p>Man being made ſo abominable by ſin, and ſo great an eyeſore to my divine Eſſence, I in mercy was mov'd, not to reflect ſo much upon the injury done to my Supream Majeſty, as not to condole the greatneſs of his deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable miſery, &amp; was more inclin'd to compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate his weakneſs; then to be reveng'd of his crime. Whereupon to repair his loſs, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to mediate his peace with my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, and in order to ſo great a work, I contracted with humane nature ſo ſtrict an alliance, that I became both God and man, which was ſo grateful to my Father, that he not only forgave man all his paſt tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but alſo receiv'd him into favour with all the demonſtrations of joy that could be expreſs'd. Who would ever expect that ſo large and ſo dangerous a breach ſhould ever
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:151886:54"/>be repair'd? who would ever imagine that two things ſo oppoſit one to the other, as is the divine, to humane nature; ſhould come to ſubſiſt and remain together, not in one houſe, not at one table, nor in one bed, but in one and the ſelf-ſame perſon. This is a miracle beyond the expectation of man, and indeed beyond th'expreſſion of an Angel, for there cann't be any two more contrary then is God and the Sinner: yet now what two can be more firmly united, or have greater influence, then God and man. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſublime then God,
<note place="margin">Pulvis es &amp; in pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.</note> and nothing more vile, and deſpicable then man.

               <p>Who would ever believe that man, to ſee him naked after his diſmal fall, and abſcond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one corner or other in Paradiſe for to keep himſelf from Gods indignation and wrath, who would believe I ſay, that ſuch a fordid and contemptable ſubſtance, ſhould be in time united to God in one and the ſame Perſon?</p>
               <p>This was a ſtrange union indeed, and a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:151886:54"/>true lovers knot, for when it was upon the diſſolution at the time of my Paſſion, it did not in the leaſt fail, but was rather violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated, to ſhew what an amorous incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation I had to be ſtill united to humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

               <p>O Lord! I am ſo much oblig'd to thee, for this extraordinary great favour, that I am not able to return thee ſufficient thanks, for the way and means which thou haſt taken to redeem me, and my very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is ſo great a benefit, that no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical tongue is able to expreſs it. All that I can ſay, is, that I am bound by all the ties both of nature and conſcience to love thee, and ſtand ſubmiſſive to thy laws for ever: Thou haſt deliver'd my Soul out of the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Dragon's jaws: and without any merit of mine, but meerly through the multitude of thy mercies, thou haſt reconcil'd me to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:151886:55"/>thy ſelf, This is eternally worthy of praiſe. But if I conſider how, and after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thou haſt done me that unſpeakable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, I ſhall finde that it does exceed even that great work of my redemption.

<note place="margin">Mirabilis Deus in Sanctis ſuis</note> and tho' man when he conſiders one, does really believe that nothing can go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, it's ſo prodigious in his eye, yet when he brings his minde to the ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of another of thy wonders, his former amazement is over, and his eyes are totally fix'd upon this,

               <p>THou ſayſt true, O Man, for thy Love I was content to be born in a ſtable, laid in a manger, betwixt an Ox and an Aſs, to receive a little heat by their breathing; wrap'd up in clouts, and was eight days after my Nativity circumcis'd; ſo early did I make an effuſion of part of my blood, and ſpent the remainder to the laſt drop on the Croſs for thy Redemption.

               <p>For thy ſake, O man, was I betray'd by my own Diſciple, apprehended by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly and Malignant Rabble, forſaken by my Friends, deny'd by the chief of my Apoſtles, ſold to my Enemies for a trifle, Arraign'd before a Judge; accus'd as a Criminal, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd and condemn'd as a notorious Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor; expos'd to the Scoffs and deriſions of the Multitude: Before my Execution I was ſcourg'd with no leſs cruelty, then ſhame and diſgrace: deliver'd over to th'inſolence of inſulting, and bloudy Soldiers, who Crown'd me with Thorns as a Mock-King, in deriſion and Scorn. <hi>In Fine,</hi> I was led to execution, nail'd to a ſhameful Croſs, expos'd to the view of all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Thieves, as if I had been an Impoſtor, a Cheat, and the worſt of Men.

               <p>O My dear Lord and Maſter, thou haſt ſaid enough to conquer my heart, and to bring alſo the whole univerſe to admire the greatneſs of thy love for man. For what can be more worthy of our admiration then to behold a God of ſo infinite a Majeſty finiſh his life under the notion of a notorious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, upon a ſhameful Croſs, and betwixt two Thieves. Had I ſeen a man (tho' he were the baſeſt and moſt vile amongſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) brought to that misfortune, as to be condemn'd (for his crime) to dy ſo cruel a death, certainly I could not chooſe but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate his condition, and condole that his misdemeanours ſhould have brought him to ſo great a diſtreſs. If it be then a ſubject wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our compaſſion to ſee a man of that infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour rank and condition, for his own crimes in ſo deplorable a ſtate, what will it be, I pray, to ſee, not a man, but the Lord of all created things, (for the Sins of his ſervants) reduc'd to that extremity? Can there be any thing more wonderfull, then to ſee even God himſelf plung'd into ſo great an abyſs of anguiſhes and pains for the ſins and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of wretched Men? If the calamity, and misfortune ſuffer'd, muſt be retaliated

Alas! there is no proportion betwixt the life of man, and that of God; betwixt the tears of a ſilly creature, and that of an omnipotent Creator.

Thou can'ſt not deny but that thou art wholly mine by three ſeveral titles. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I created thee, thou, with all that thou haſt belongeſt to me: Secondly, becauſe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:151886:60"/>thee, thou art mine as aforeſaid, but by a more ſtrict title: Thirdly, becauſe thou haſt promis'd in thy Baptiſm to be mine for ever; and therefore, without committing a Sacriledge, thou canſt not diſpoſe of thy ſelf otherwiſe: why then doſt thou delay to give thy ſelf wholly to me, and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, being thou art mine already by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny juſt titles? O Ingratitude never to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel'd! O hardneſs of neart never to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently admir'd! Thou art certainly more obdurate, then ever the moſt impenetrable Rocks, ſince that thou wilt not relent and ſuffer thy ſelf to be gain'd by ſo many, and ſuch extraordinary great favours. There is nothing ſo hard but may be mollifi'd by ſome art or another; the moſt obdurate mettle is mollifi'd by fire; Iron is made pliable by the ſame element; the hardneſs of an Adamant is overcome and made ſoft with the bloud of a Buck; but thy heart, O man, is harder then any rock, harder then ſteel, harder then the very Adamant; being neither the fire of Hell, nor the charms of thy heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, no, nor the bloud of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Lamb can mollify it, and make it tractable and ſubmiſſive to my commands. How doſt thou think I can bear ſuch horrid ingratitude? I lov'd thee, and thou doſt hate me; I have laid ſeveral obligations on thee,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:151886:61"/>and thou doſt forget them all, being thou art not aſham'd or afraid to offend me at all hours, and upon all occaſions. O man! what can'ſt thou love if thou doſt not love me? what favour can move thee to a kinde return, if my benefits can't prevail? how canſt thou but love, ſerve and worſhip me, who am ſo much inamour'd with thee, who have ſought thee when thou wert loſt, with ſo much care and diligence; and who have redeem'd thee from all evil with ſo much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and toil.</p>

O man!

               <p>O My God, my King, my Saviour, my Judge, and my only comfort! Thou art I confeſs the Eternal Wiſdom, and thy words to me are Spirit and Life, for they have made me reſolve to bid adieu for ever
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:151886:63"/>to Sin, and to plant virtue where vice was before in great requeſt; but give me leave to ask thee what would the benefit of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption avail me, if that of my Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had not enſu'd? for by this it is, that the virtue of the former is appli'd to the diſeaſes of my Soul; and even as a plaiſter (tho' ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſoveraign) will ſignify nothing except it be laid unto the wound, ſo that heavenly medicine would be of no uſe or advantage to me, if it had not been appli'd, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of this unſpeakable benefit, to the bruiſes which I receiv'd in that fatal field of <hi>Eden,</hi> where all mankinde were ſhamefully foil'd, and quite overthrown in the Perſon of <hi>Adam.</hi> The Sanctification of man does chiefly appertain to the Holy Ghoſt: 'Tis his prerogative to prevent the Sinner with the ſweetneſs of his mercy, then to call him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing call'd, to juſtify him, and being juſtifi'd to direct him, and leade him on to the end of his courſe, and then to gratify him with a crown of glory: wherefore I may juſtly ſay, that this very benefit is the happy comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all others; for by this man is regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd in the number of Gods children, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd of the main weight of his iniquities, deliver'd from the dominion and Tyranny of the Devil; reviv'd from Death to Life, brought from the ſtate of Sin, to that of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,

               <p>O Moſt gracious Saviour! I am through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinc'd of the truth of thy words; I confeſs that Sin is the greateſt of all evils, and that the greateſt misfortune that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall a poor man in this world, is to lie under the tyranny of ſo helliſh a monſter; for it does not only deprive his Soul of thy grace, but alſo robs her of all the ſupernatural treaſures and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which ſhe had receiv'd in her Baptiſm, and which brought her to that height of honour, as to become thy beautiful and dearly beloved Spouſe. No ſooner is ſhe degraded thus, and forc'd out of that ſuper-eminent &amp; glorious Station, but Sin ſets on her again to finiſh what it had left undone, he wounds her even to death, and after he has taken the moſt precious of her goods, he plunders her of the leaſt conſiderable, as are her natural gifts. For man being a rational creature, and Sin
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:151886:67"/>being an act contrary to reaſon, 'tis conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to nature that one contrary ſhould ſtrive to deſtroy to 'ther; conſequently the oftner Sin is multiply'd, the more it diſturbs, and deſtroys the powers and faculties of the Soul, not in themſelves, but in their operations. 'Tis by this means that Sin gets dominion of the Soul, and makes her run what courſe he pleaſes; if ſhe has any remaining inclination to virtue; Alas, ſhe is become ſo weak, ſo ſloathful, and ſo inconſtant that ſhe cann't attain to the practiſe of it;

               <p>THou muſt know then, O man! that this ſo great a renovation, when 'tis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the means of Baptiſm, may be call'd Regeneration; but if it be done by Contrition, and with the aſſiſtance of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, then 'tis call'd reſurrection, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the Soul is rais'd from the Death of Sin, to the Life of Grace, but by reaſon it reſembles ſo nearly the glorious beauty of future Reſurrection. No mortal tongue is able to expreſs the radiant Splendor, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent beauty of a Juſtifi'd Soul; 'tis a miſtery reſerv'd to my Holy Spirit, who made her ſo glorious, with a deſign ſhe ſhould be his own Temple and place of reſidence. Were all the wealth of the World, all the imaginable dignities and honours of this life, all the natural Graces and gifts, together with all the acquir'd virtues, and all other earthly advantages that can be thought of; conferr'd with the beauty and treaſures of a Juſtifi'd Soul; all, in compariſon with her, is vile, obſcure, ill-favour'd, and of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue: No, for there is as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the life of Grace, and the life of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, betwixt the beauty of the Soul Juſtifi'd, and that of the body; betwixt the interiour
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:151886:69"/>Riches of ſuch a Soul, and the exteriour of the body, as there is betwixt Heaven &amp; Earth, betwixt the Spirit and the body, or betwixt Time and Eternity. Becauſe all theſe are circumſcrib'd with certain limits, they are temporal, they appear handſom to corporal eyes, and require only my general concourſe to ſupport them, whereas the other depends on my particular and ſupernatural influence; and have no prefix'd bounds, becauſe I am their object, and they are ſo precious in my ſight, and of ſo great an eſtimate, that they provoke even my divine Eſſence to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently enamour'd with their beauty. I might have wrought all theſe wonders with my ſole preſence, yet I would not; but was pleas'd to adorn the Soul with my infus'd virtues, and the Seven gifts of my Holy Ghoſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not only her Eſſence, but even her very faculties are cloth'd and adorn'd with thoſe habitual and heavenly dreſſes.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe divine favours and benefits ſhe is made happy with the conſtant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of my divine Spirit, and of the moſt adorable Trinity, for all reſides in a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd Soul to teach her how to manage ſo great a treaſure to her beſt advantage;

               <p>All the Doctors of my Holy Church, as well Eccleſiaſtick, as Scholaſtick, grounded upon theſe my words, do firmly believe that my Holy Ghoſt dwells in a juſtifi'd Soul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a certain and peculiar manner, and ſay moreover that he does not only confer his Gifts upon her, but comes himſelf along with them, with a fix'd reſolution to clenſe, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify and adorn her, as well with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant preſence, as with all his heavenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:151886:70"/>moſt deſerving of them, I ſhall add more preſſing motives to bring thee to ſo good, ſo gracious, and ſo benificial a reſolution.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> that occurs is, that all the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd are my living members, ſo that I love and cheriſh them as my own, and am no leſs careful to provide for them, to protect and comfort them, then were they all parts of my proper body; nay, without any intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I influence them with my inſpirations and graces, even as the head communicates his vital Spirits into all the reſt of its members; moreover my Eternal Father beholds them with a gracious eye, as being my living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, united, &amp; concorporate with me by the participation of his divine Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all their deeds are grateful and merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to him, as being the worthy products of my lively loving and gracious Children, and becauſe that all their virtue, and power of doing well, proceeds from me alone.</p>
               <p>This certainly is a great incouragement to all juſtifi'd Souls to crave what favours they ſtand in need of, and to ask of my heavenly Father, with a great deal of confidence, and hopes to obtain their requeſts: being it is not only for themſelves they ask it, but alſo for me, who am highly honour'd in them, &amp; with them; for no man will deny but what the members do, the head does the ſame, &amp;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:151886:70"/>what is confer'd upon the one, is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd upon the other; conſequently being that I am the head of the juſtifi'd, what they ask for themſelves, they ask the ſame for me.</p>

For when a kindeneſs is exhibited to one for the love of another, the favour is chiefly done to him, for whoſe ſake it was granted, and indeed thou oughteſt to believe that when thou ſheweſt mercy to the poor for Gods ſake, thou art not only merciful to them, but even to God himſelf.</p>

The Sons of mortall Parents muſt expect a mortal Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; Death is the end of great and ſmall: Thou art born helpleſs, and expos'd to the injuries of all Creatures, and of all weathers. The very neceſſaries of life may procure thy

For whether they dye by a ſword, by a halter, by a potion, or by a diſeaſe, 'tis all but Death, which is ſo certain that thou can'ſt not doubt of it, without a blemiſh to thy Faith; none is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from drinking of this Chalice;

<note place="margin">

               <p>O Moſt gracious Redeemer? I cann't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny what thou ſayſt of a dying man, and of the Anguiſhes which he ſhall ſuffer at the departing of the Soul from his body; ſhe ſhall enter into Judgment alone, naked, poor, and without any to patronize her cauſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept her good works, (if ſhe has any to ſhew;) her Conſcience will be the Deponent, the Triall will be either for life, or death not temporal, but eternal, and thou an injur'd Judge, ſhall appear to her in a dreadful Throne to give ſentence for her, or againſt her, either of Salvation, or of her everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damnation. If ſhe be grievouſly indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not able to ballance her accounts, O what a horrible confuſion ſhe will be in, grief and ſorrow, ſighs and tears, dreadful lamentations and crys, will be her woful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:151886:76"/>and the only motives ſhe can produce to mollify thee O Lord, but all will be to no purpoſe, her repentance comes too late, 'tis totally fruitleſs at that hour; all her proteſtations of amendment will be in vain, no bills or bonds of performance will be accepted of, no bail ſhall be taken, her leaſe is out, ſhe muſt remove: her nobility, her riches, her honours cann't obtain for her a further reſpite of time; the ſentence is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd, the decree is unavoidable; ſhe muſt ſubmit.</p>

To another objection he anſwer'd, that is true likewiſe, but for that fault, I often ſhed moſt bitter tears. To another he would reply, that's a grand lye, I am innocent of that crime. Again, he would anſwer, 'tis

Certainly this was a ſpectacle able to terrify the hearts of all them that were by, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, for that the poor man was accus'd of what he never committed; ſo eager his mortal Enemies were to get poſſeſſion of his Soul, by endeavouring to puſh him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſpair.

And if thou wilt give credit to the depoſition of a learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour; he will tell thee that even an Image, which was only my repreſentation on the Croſs, appear'd with ſuch wrathful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd eyes to a congregation of People, that they all fell unto the ground ſenſeleſs &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any motion, and that they cuntinued in that amazement ſeveral hours.

Thus I ſhall come to Judge and revenge the injuries which they have done unto me: I am righteous in my Juſtice, as I am in my mercy, and as I have allotted a time for mercy, ſo I will for Juſtice; and as in this life the rigour of my juſtice is as it were repreſs'd and ſuſpended, ſo in that point of Death, when the Sinners are to receive their final Sentence, I will ſuffer it to break

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:151886:81"/>many poor Souls haſt thou led aſtray from my paths, by thy poyſonous doctrine, and evil examples, how many poor Souls are now in Hell-fire ſolely upon the account of the damnable principles which thou haſt ſtill'd into their ears and hearts, and which they carry'd along with them to their graves? How many innocent, and virtuous young Maids, and Women, haſt thou forc'd out of my ſervice to ſatisfy thy luſtful deſires; I ſay forc'd them, becauſe that perceiving them in a wanting condition, thou haſt wrought upon their neceſſity, and weakneſs both, by giving them what thou ſhouldſt have kept for the maintenance of thy proper Wife and Children. Aſſure thy ſelf, that in the hour of thy death, I ſhall appear unto thee as a Bear whom thou haſt robb'd of ſo many young ones, yea, and ſhall tear thy entrails in peices, for all thy misdemeanours, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and oppreſſions. I will devour thee as a Lyon, as well for working the deſtruction of thy own Soul, as for contributing to the loſs of many others by thy bad examples.</p>
               <p>'Tis by reaſon of the ſeverity of my Juſtice againſt Sinners in the hour of their death that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſays, there ſhall proceed from my face a River of fire, becauſe this Element of all others is the moſt active, and ſo pure that it will not admit of any mixture; whereas
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:151886:81"/>Earth will lodge in its boſom Mines of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mettals, and Quarries of divers ſorts of Stone; Water will entertain a pleaſant va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Fiſhes, the Air gives liberty to all ſorts of Fowl to fly through all it's region, and does alſo harbour a vaſt multitude of vapours, exhalations and ſeveral other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but Fire endures nothing, it melts the hardeſt mettals, reduces even ſtones into Cinders, conſumes living Creatures, converts Trees into its own Subſtance, and turns all that is contrary to it, into its own nature. The ſame ſhall happen in that day of my wrath; all ſhall be rigour and Juſtice, without any mixture of mercy; nay, the very mercies which I have exhibited to ſinners in their life time, ſhall then be both a motive to kindle my indignation, and fuel to blaze up my incenſed Juſtice againſt them.</p>
               <p>O man! conſider therefore whilſt thou haſt time to repent, nay, and ſeriouſlytoo, what a ſad condition thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelf in, at that inſtant, when neither my bloud ſhed for thee, nor my ſelf crucifi'd for thy ſake, nor the powerful interceſſion of my moſt bleſſed Mother, nor the prayers of my Saints, no, nor my divine mercy it ſelf, ſhall contribute any thing to thy ſafety. No, this life once paſt, thou art to expect no Patron, no Protectour, but thy virtuous

Thy Wife, thy Children, thy Kindred, Friends, and Followers, ſhall go no farther then the grave with thee; but the Strangers which thou haſt lodg'd, the ſick which thou haſt viſited, and the needy which thou haſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour'd will bear thee company even before my dreadful Throne, and place thee at my right hand, among the number of my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever.</p>

This joy is adorn'd with two ſingular qualities, the firſt whereof makes it ſo vigorous and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that it excludes all grief, all pain, and in a word,
<note place="margin">St. <hi>Aug.</hi> medita. 22.</note> all manner of evil; This is conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to what St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays, where he crys ont: O Lord! the life which thou haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for thy friends, is a bleſſed life, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure life, a quiet life, a life that knows no death, a life without ſadneſs, without labour, without grief, without trouble, without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, without fear, without variety, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alteration: A life repleniſh'd with all beauty and dignity, where there is neither Enemy that can offend, nor delight that can annoy; where love admits of no mixture of hatred, or diſdain, where the day is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, where the ſpirit of all is one, where

For the love and joy which ſprings from the clear viſion of my divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is ſo powerful, that it's enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert even Hell into Heaven; in ſo much, as if to the moſt tormented Soul in hell were added all the torments of the reſt of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both men and Devils, and that I ſhould vouenſafe him but one glimpſe of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that only viſion, tho' in the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, were ſufficient to free him from all thoſe evils both of ſin and pain; ſo that his Soul being extaſi'd by that unſpeakable beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which he beheld, would not be ſenſible of any grief or pain whatever. By this thou mayſt eaſily conceive the omnipotency of that joy which I confer upon my beloved in Heaven, which if I ſhould impart to the moſt damn'd in hell, it would convert all his great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into far greater conſolations.</p>

               <p>The Second ſtupendious wonder which the greatneſs of my joy produces in the Souls of my belov'd, is the manifold pleaſures which ſpring from it, as from a moſt fruitful root. Art thou not aſtoniſh'd to hear that the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Souls ſhould cauſe ſo many and marvellous effects in the bodies of my Bleſſed, as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> relates, doſt thou not wonder when he tells thee, that my beatifical viſion carries ſo unſpeakable a joy with it into their Souls, that it wholly changes their bodies, makes them as beautiful as ſo many Angels, reſplendent as the Sun, immortal as a Spirit, and as impaſſible as even my ſelf. What mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and prodigies it works in their bodies by the redundancy of the unſpeakable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which they feel in their ſpirits. Art thou not ſeiz'd with admiration, when St. <hi>Anſelme</hi> tells thee, that if the body of one of my Bleſſed, endow'd with the four gifts of glory, full of clearneſs, ſplendor; and beauty, were plac'd in any part, or corner of the world, it would perfume the whole univerſe with a fragrancy infinitely more ſweet unto their Sences, then that of Musk and Amber; doſt thou not ſee how immenſe is that light and joy of the Bleſſed Souls in Heaven, which tranſmits this ſo unſpeakable a luſter and beauty unto their Bodies; and how can it be leſs, being it proceeds from my beatifical vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:151886:95"/>and that it is the very ſame joy which I have my ſelf, and which is ſufficient to make me bleſſed with a bleſſedneſs equal to my ſelf: It's therefore I ſay unto my beloved Servant;

Obſerve alſo that there is not a Creature in this world, which has not for his final end ſome manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and that thoſe Creatures which are indu'd with reaſon and knowledge, have in that perfection a particular joy and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, which is greater or leſſer according as their end is more or leſs perfect; Now thou muſt of neceſſity acknowledge that my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection infinitely exceeds that of all Creatures, conſequently the joy which is in my ſelf (for I have no end or perfection diſtinct from my ſelf) is infinitely greater then the joy of all Creatures; and this infinite joy out of my infinite goodneſs I was pleas'd to impart as well to the Bleſſed Souls, as to the Angels, tho' ſo great, and ſo ſpecial a felicity was in no way due unto their humane nature; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou muſt confeſs that the joy of Saints,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:151886:96"/>which is that of my beatifical viſion, and wherein my joy and happineſs does conſiſt, is infinite, and that all the contents and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world in compariſon to it, are Aloes, Gall, and Wormwood. The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers will tell thee, that by how much a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable object cloſes nearer to the faculty, by ſo much greater is the joy and delight which it produces therein; natural reaſon will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thee that of all objects I am the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and the moſt delightful, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being in the beatifical viſion united to the Souls of my Saints in heaven with the moſt intimate union that can be in a pure creature, muſt of neceſſity cauſe an unſpeakable joy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably greater then all the joys reall or imaginable, which can be produc'd by all the creatures that were, are at preſent, or will be extant to the end of the world: for as my Divine perfection contains within it ſelf the perfections of all created things, poſſible, and imaginable, ſo the joy which it cauſes in the Souls of the Bleſſed, muſt be infinitely great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then all other joys, which either have or can be caus'd by the creature.</p>

If this created life be pleaſing to thee, how much more pleaſing muſt that increated life be, which gave it a beginning, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it cann't ſubſiſt one moment.

The ſecond is <hi>Agility</hi> and this prerogative of the Juſt is no leſs then the former, for by this,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:151886:101"/>their fleſh is free'd from that lumpiſh &amp; heavy weight which kept their Spirits fetter'd whilſt they remain'd in this life, and made as light even as the Angels themſelves, who paſs from one extremity of the world to the other in the twinkling of an eye; the third gift is <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Strength,</hi> which does ſo abound in a glorifi'd body, that he ſhall be able to move the whole globe of the Earth, at thy command, and give us a dry paſſage through the main Ocean, with as much eaſe as thy Angel did to the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the red Seas, to avoid the Rage and fury of their purſuing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemys. The fourth is <hi>I enetration,</hi> whereby he ſhall be able to penetrate any other bodies tho'never ſo hard, or maſſy, and make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to peirce Walls, Doors, the Earth, and the very Firmament, tho' it were made of Braſs; This thy glorifi'd body has perform'd after thy Reſurrection, for thou didſt pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the houſe where thy Diſciples were, the Doors being all ſhut, and at thy Aſcenſion thou didſt penetrate the Heavens alſo. The fifth prerogative is abſolute <hi>Health</hi> free from all pains of this life, quit of all diſeaſes, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, incumbrances, and all other infirmitys incident to humane nature, and ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually fix'd in a moſt perfect and flouriſhing ſtate of health and felicity, in no way liable to the leaſt alteration for ever.

                  <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> which ſhall be heap'd upon a glorifi'd body to that degree, that all his ſenſes ſhall finde their peculiar and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per objects in a far more delicious manner then ever they could expect in this world; for his eyes ſhall be for ever recreated with the beatifical viſion, and with the ſight of the moſt glorious and beautiful bodies of all the Saints.

If the Lyre of <hi>Orpheus</hi> was able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſuch great prodigies in the World; and to win the hearts not only of men, but alſo of the Infernal Spirits (if we may believe Poets) who tell us that he recover'd his Wife out of their clutches with the ſweetneſs of his melodious inſtruments: If St. <hi>Francis</hi> thought himſelf already in Heaven hearing an Angel play on his inſtrument, what pleaſure, what delight will a bleſſed Soul have when he hears the ſweet harmony of ſo many thouſands of Angels together? Tradition which gives life to the beſt of Hiſtorys, informs us that the ſinging of one little bird alone, raviſh'd a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Monk to that degree that three hundred years ſeem'd no more to him then three hours, what a ſweetneſs will it be to hear the melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of thoſe Songs, which the innumerable citizens of that heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſing in praiſe of thee, their eternal King! his ſmell ſhall be recreated with the moſt odoriferous ſcent which comes from thoſe beautiful bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, infinitely more ſweet then all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:151886:102"/>of the Indies. <hi>In fine,</hi> the whole glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd body ſhall be fill'd with abundance of all kind of conſolation; the Eyes, the Ears, the Noſe, the Mouth, the Hands, the Throat, the Lungs, the Heart, the Stomach, the Back, nay, the very Intrals, and every part of the Body,
<note place="margin">Inebria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buntur ab ubertate Domus tuae, &amp; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptatis tuae pora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis eos. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 35.9.</note> ſhall be repleniſh'd with ſuch unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſweetneſs and pleaſure; that it may be really ſaid, the whole man is made to drink of the River of thy divine delights, and made drunk with the abundance of thy moſt glorious and plentiful houſe.</p>
               <p>The Seventh and laſt prerogative of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifi'd body is what the Divines call. <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> that is ſecurity of life, which agrees well with that place of Scripture, where 'tis ſaid, the Juſt will live for ever; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> avers,
<note place="margin">Juſti au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuum vivent. <hi>Sap</hi> 5.16. Mors illi ultra non dominabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Ro.</hi> 6.9.</note> that Death has no more dominion over him. And this is one of the chiefeſt prerogatives &amp; moſt excellent Dignities of a glorifi'd body; for by the great benefit of this unſpeakable favour, he is free'd from all care, all doubt, all fear, all danger, all hurt, all annoyance, and all manner of accidents that may croſs him, or give any diſturbance to his ever laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace and reſt. O how ſweet will the fruit of a virtuous life be then to his palate, how pleaſant will all his mortifications and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, all his perſecutions and troubles, all the wrongs and injuries, all the aſperſions &amp;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:151886:103"/>calumnies, which were heap'd upon him by his apparent enemies, or by his counterfeit friends, and which he willingly ſuffer'd for thy ſake, how pleaſant, I ſay, they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him, and he to them, how he will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them as being inſtrumental to his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſettlement in Glory! for tho' they ſeem'd bitter to him in this life, yet in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven they will taſt moſt ſweet to him, and he will think himſelf highly honour'd to have been ſo ill treated for Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Sweet is the cool evening after the hot ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers day, ſweet is the fountain to the weary Traveller, ſweet is the reſt and ſleep to the tir'd Servant; but much more ſweet is it to the Saints in Heaven, to enjoy eaſe after their manifold troubles, tranquility after their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and croſſes, peace after their long &amp; tedious war; Security after all their dangers, and reſt after all their pains and travels. For then all their grievances are at an end; then their Skirmiſhes, and conflicts with their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies are laid aſide, there's no more talk of them, they lay down their Arms for ever, and remain in peace.</p>

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:151886:103"/>under the ſhaddow of his own Pavilion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd the ſweet advantage of a delightful peace. Now may the bodys of thy Saints,

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:151886:106"/>tranſitory and vain; whereas happineſs is permanent; nor is it to be eſtimated by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, meaſure, or parts: for it is full, and perfect; this is <hi>Seneca</hi> the moral Philoſophers diſcourſe; which ſhould make thee, O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man! bluſh to ſet ſo ſlender an eſtimate upon my glory, and upon the everlaſting happineſs which I promiſe unto thee, if thou wilt reſolve to lead a virtuous and godly life, and depreſs thy paſſions with the dint of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and Pennance; but thou doſt not anſwer my expectation, and yet wouldſt fain be admitted into my glory at a cheaper rate then I had it my ſelf.</p>
               <p>This Pagan Philoſopher ſhall riſe in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt thee; and his following expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions will certainly condemn the little care thou haſt of thy Salvation. I do not, ſays he, ſpeak as if my ſelf were arriv'd at that bleſſed ſtate of repoſe: but yet it is ſomething to be on the mending hand. It is with me, as with a man that's creeping out of a diſeaſe; he feels yet ſome grudgings of it, he is every foot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining his pulſe; and ſuſpects every touch of heat to be a relick of his fevour: Juſt at that rate, am I jealous of my ſelf. The beſt remedy that I know in this caſe, is to go on with confidence, and not to be miſled by the errors of other People. It is with our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as with our healths; 'tis a degree of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:151886:106"/>virtue, the abating of vice, as it is a degree of health, the abating of a fit.</p>
               <p>Could a Chriſtian ſpeak better; or more to the purpoſe? could he take a more aſſured way to prevent the increaſe of vice, then what he preſcribes? Hear him once more ſpeak; ſome ſays he, will place their happineſs in wealth; ſome in the liberty of the body; and others in the pleaſure of the ſenſe, and Palate. But what are mettals, Taſts, Sounds, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, to the minde of a reaſonable creature? he that ſets his heart upon the riches of this world the very fear of poverty will be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to him. He that's ambitious, ſhall be gall'd with envy at a man that's prefer'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: For in that caſe, he that is not firſt, is laſt. I do not, ſays he, ſpeak againſt Riches: for if they hurt a man 'tis his own folly: they may be indeed the cauſe of miſchief; as they are a temptation to thoſe that do it. Inſtead of courage they may inſpire a man with arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance; and inſtead of magnanimity, with inſolence; which is in truth but the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiet of heroick mindes, and where's the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Luxury; when a man divides his life betwixt the Kitchen, and the ſtews; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt an anxious conſcience, and a naufeous Stomach? <hi>Caliguia,</hi> was born to ſhew the world what miſchief might be done by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of great wickedneſs, and a great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:151886:107"/>he ſpent near 10000<hi>l.</hi> Sterling upon a Supper. The works and inventions of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury are indeed prodigious, not only in the counterfieting of nature, but even in ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it. The <hi>Romans</hi> had their brooks even in their very parlours, and found their dinners under their Tables. The Mullet was reckon'd ſtale unleſs it dy'd in the hand of the Guieſt, And they had their glaſſes to put them into, that they might the better obſerve all the changes, and motions of them in the laſt Agony betwixt life and Death. So that they fed their eyes, before their bodies. Theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would not have given themſelves half this trouble with a dying friend; nay, they would leave a Father or a Brother at his laſt hour, to entertain themſelves with the barbarous ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of an expiring Fiſh.</p>
               <p>O man! thou art a Chriſtian, and one that pretends to the height of perfection, which is to follow me, and ground thy life as well upon my councels, as upon my examples; thou haſt in thy Baptiſm made a ſolemn oath to have an everlaſting abhorrence of the world, the fleſh and the Devil, thou haſt renounc'd them for ever; thou haſt declar'd thy ſelf an Enemy to all ſorts of vice, yet thou art more a ſlave to them then ever the <hi>Romans</hi> were to their bellies, ſo that I verily believe, had this Pagan Philoſopher been now alive, and ſeen
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:151886:107"/>the liberty that Chriſtians take to run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into diſorders, and debauchery, he would conclude their Religion to be far worſe then that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was no other then to indulge their bodies in all that might be pleaſing to their Palate. Let him yet ſpeak more of his minde to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and thou ſhalt finde that what enormities he lays to their charge, is now adays the common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Chriſtians. That ſays he, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hances the eſteem of every thing, is the price of it: In ſo much, that water it ſelf, which ought to be gratuitous, is expos'd to ſale, in their Conſervatories of Ice, and Snow. Nay, we are troubl'd that we cann't buy breath, light, and that we have the Air it ſelf <hi>gratis.</hi> And if our conditions be evil, our trouble is, that nature has left ſomething to us in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: But Luxury contrives ways to ſet a price upon the moſt neceſſary and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable benefits in nature: even thoſe benefits, which are free to Birds, and Beaſts, as well as to men; and ſerve indifferently for the uſe of the moſt Sluggiſh Creatures.</p>
               <p>But how chances it, that fountain-water is not cool enough to ſerve us, unleſs it be bound up in Ice? So long as the Stomach is moderatly ſatisfi'd, Nature diſcharges her functions without trouble: but when the blood comes to be inflam'd with exceſs of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:151886:108"/>wine, or the Stomach overcharg'd with meat, ſimple water is not cool enough to Allay it's heat; then we are forc'd to make uſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyes, which remedies themſelves are vices. And this is the product of heaping Suppers upon Dinners, and Dinners upon Suppers without intermiſſion.</p>
               <p>The natural thirſt, (be it never ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not deriv'd from libidinous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) is eaſily quench'd with a draught of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, tho' it be of the River it will ſuffice; but, when the palate is grown ſqueemiſh, we taſte nothing; &amp; that which we take for thirſt, is only the rage of a Fevour, or ſome other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper acquir'd by diſorder: Even the very Women are in ſome meaſure guilty of this extravagance, for tho' they have not alter'd their natures, they have chang'd the courſe of their lives; and by taking the liberties of men, they partake as well of their diſeaſes, as of their wickedneſs. They ſit up late, drink as much, nay, in their very Appetites they are as maſculine too; in a word, they have loſt the modeſty, and other advantages of their Sex, by their vices.</p>
               <p>O man! are not theſe the abominations and Crimes now in vogue, in that corrupt and licentious Age thou liv'ſt in? What this good moral Philoſoper blames in the <hi>Romans,</hi> is it not the common practice of Chriſtians now a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:151886:108"/>days, nay, they are guilty of far greater crimes; for they do not only pamper their Luſts, but provoke them; as if they were to learn the very art of voluptuouſneſs. And wherein is their corrupt nature depreſs'd all this while? for I ſee nothing deny'd to their craving Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, no violence us'd to their ſenſuality, no bounds ſet to their womaniſh deſires. They give all the beſt entertainment they can to their bodies, and take no care at all of their Souls. It is with them as with an innocent that a certain Noble-man had in his Family; She became blind on a Sudden, and no body could perſwade her ſhe was blind; ſhe could not endure the houſe (ſhe ſaid) it was ſo dark, and was ſtill calling to go abroad. That which the people laugh'd at in her, is found to be true in the greateſt part of mankinde: They are Covetous, Luxurious, Ambitious, and what not? but the world ſhall never bring them to acknowledge it. Nay, they are the worſt of the two; for that blinde fool call'd for a guide, and they wander about without any, and which is worſe, they will have none, It's a hard matter to cure thoſe that will not believe they are ſick. This is thy caſe O man! thou haſt been told often of thy deſperate condition; and how thy Soul is in danger to be loſt for ever; unleſs that thou doſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with my inſtructions, and break off that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:151886:109"/>ſinful yoak of Satan, that brings thee by one evil to make way for another. Thou wert told that the Kingdome of Heaven ſuffers vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, &amp; that to become an Inhabitant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, thou muſt of neceſſity ſtruggle with thy Paſſions, and overcome them too, which is to deſtroy a numerous company of Monſters, and the moſt glorious action that can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken. <hi>Horatius Cocles</hi> oppos'd his ſingle body to a whole Army, till the Bridge was cut down behinde him, and then leap'd into the River, with his Sword in his hand, and came off ſafe to his own party; this was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous act indeed; but it is a more noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit to ſubdue thy corrupt nature, thou doſt ſignalize thy ſelf, when thou art become thine own Maſter, and triumphs over thy paſſions, which have vanquiſh'd the greateſt Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the world; when thou ſhalt ſtand like another <hi>Hercules</hi> and beat down thoſe inbred monſters of thy old man, with as much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as he did ſubdue the <hi>Hidra's,</hi> and <hi>Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taures,</hi> then thou wilt arrive at the higheſt piteh of felicity. Be not ſurpriz'd that I call thy Paſſions Monſters of nature, for they are not only monſtrous in themſelves, but they make the mind that is harraſs'd with them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deform'd and moſt miſerable to boot; for they leave no place either for Councel or friendſhip, honeſty or good manners; no
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:151886:109"/>place either for the exerciſe of reaſon, or for the Offices of life. If I were to deſcribe the Paſſion of anger, which is the common diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of all mankinde, I would draw a Tiger bath'd in bloud, ſharp ſet, and ready to take a leap at his prey, or dreſs it up as the Poets repreſent their furys, with whips, Snakes, and flames: It ſhould be ſour, livid, full of Scars, and wallowing in gore, raging up and down, deſtroying, grinning, bellowing, and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſick of all other things, and moſt of all of it ſelf. It turns beauty into deformity, and the calmeſt councels into fierceneſs; It diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the very garments of thoſe that are ſlaves to it, and fills their mindes with horror: How abominable muſt it be in the Soul then, when it appears ſo hideous even through the bones, the skin, and ſo many impediments. Is he not a monſter of a man that has loſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf; and is toſs'd hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his Raging fury, as by a tempeſt? He is the executioner of his own revenge, both with his heart and hand; and the murtherer of his neareſt friends. The ſmalleſt matter will blow him up to that degree that he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inſociable, and inacceſſible; He does all things by violence as well upon himſelf, as others. It may be then very well call'd the maſter of all Paſſions, being 'tis the moſt hard to be ſurmounted. Yet Heathens without the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:151886:110"/>aſſiſtance of my grace, or knowledge of my glory, have wholly ſubdu'd this predominate Paſſion, encourag'd thereunto only by a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular applauſe, and to get the eſteem of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect Philoſophers. <hi>Plato</hi> was about to ſtrike his Servant, and while his hand was in the Air, he check'd himſelf, but ſtill held it in that menacing poſture; being taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and ask'd what he meant: I am now, ſays he, puniſhing of an angry man. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time his Servant having committed a great fault; pray ſays he to his friend, do you beat that fellow, for I am angry; for he did not think it fit that a Servant ſhould be in his power; that is not his own maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> when he was angry, would take himſelf in it, and ſpeak low, in oppoſition to the motions of his diſpleaſure. O man! thou art promis'd a crown of glory in Heaven if thou wilt ſubdue thy paſſions on Earth; Thou art aſſur'd to ſit at my Table, and to enjoy my preſence for ever, ſo be, that thou doſt ſubdue thy evil inclinations, and keep them always in ſubjection, yet theſe powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are not ſufficient to Stir up thy droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing courage to ſo glorious an action, and ſo much to thine own advantage; whereas theſe Heathens have got the better of them all, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for to be applauded by the people, and to obtain the credit of being perfect Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:151886:110"/>I tell thee for a certain truth that they ſhall riſe in Judgment with this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cow-hearted Chriſtians,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.41, 42.</note> and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, becauſe they have ſubdu'd their Paſſions and evil inclinations only upon the bare account of vanity, which they will not perform tho' they be promis'd the reward of an Eternal weight of Glory. The Queen of the South ſhall alſo riſe in Judgment againſt them, and ſhall condemn them; for ſhe came from the uttermoſt parts of the Earth to hear the wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> whereas they will not make the leaſt progreſs in virtue to pleaſure me, who am the Fountain of wiſdom, and who went ſo many ſteps to finde out their ſtray'd Souls, when they were in danger to be loſt for ever.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtories are full of perillous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate enterprizes, and all for temporal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. In the beginning of the civil wars which the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> carried on againſt <hi>Cajus</hi> and <hi>Fulvius Gracchuus,</hi> the Conſul <hi>Opimus</hi> by publick Edict promis'd, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould bring him the head of <hi>Cajus Gracchus,</hi> ſhould receive for reward it's weight in gold. <hi>Setimuleyus</hi> undertakes the work, and cuts of the head of <hi>Gracchus</hi> with the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt danger of his own life, and fills the hollow places thereof with melted lead to have the more weight of Gold. But my promiſes far
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:151886:111"/>exceed this, being I give for leſs labour, and for a trouble as light as a feather, an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weight of glory, nay, for a draught of water; for that which is but vile, and laſts but for a moment: I give that which is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable price, and is to continue for all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. With that which is no more worth then a Straw, thou mayſt purchaſe my glory, for all the felicities, all the riches, and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights are no more then a Straw com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to it. Certainly thou wouldſt look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to be a meer fool, that would not give a chip for an hundred weight of Gold; This is thy great folly O man! thou wilt not go through the leaſt of difficultys, nor give a ſmal ſhare of thy worldly Subſtance to the poor and diſtreſs'd for the purchaſe of Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> to encourage his Soldiers in his war againſt the <hi>Medes</hi> made them a Sumptuous Banquet, with a promiſe to give them Gold and Silver in abundance, if they had ſubdu'd that effeminate Nation; if this motive was ſufficient to make a barbarous People prefer a doubtful reward before a certain and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous labour; why ſhould not a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and infinitely greater then the labour provoke thee, and all mankinde to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Heaven? Compare the banquet which I am to to exhibit to all my belov'd in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, unto that which <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave unto his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:151886:111"/>whole Army, the pleaſures of my Kingdom with the troubles, and diſpleaſures of this life, the joys above with the ſorrows below, the riches and treaſures of Paradiſe, with the little labour and pains which thou doſt take in my Service, and for which thou art pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd eternal glory as a reward, thou ſhalt finde as much difference as there is betwixt a dead body full of worms, ſtench, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and a glorious body, exceeding the Sun in brightneſs, the Heavens in beauty, and in ſweetneſs the moſt odoriferous and pureſt Roſes, or Lillies. Its therefore my Apoſtle ſays, that all which men can ſuffer in this life, is no way worthy of the glory which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd upon my Elect. No, the Stupendious mortifications and pennances of St. <hi>Simon Stylites,</hi> the Auſteritys of St. <hi>Romualdus,</hi> the poverty and nakedneſs of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold torments and tortures of all the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, are no more in compariſon of my glory then is the taking up of a Straw for the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Earthly Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> declares that the firſt man that ſhould encouuter the <hi>Jebuſeans,</hi> as being the moſt daring and warlike of all his enemies, ſhould be made General, <hi>Joab</hi> hears of it, and expos'd his life to obtain that honour at the price of his bloud. <hi>Saul</hi> offers his Daughter in marriage to him that ſhould overcome the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:151886:112"/>Giant <hi>Goliah; David</hi> embraces the motion, &amp; ſlights all danger to purchaſe ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>Seneca</hi> wonder'd at what Soldiers did, and ſuffer'd for ſo ſhort and tranſitory King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms as are thoſe of the world, and that not for themſelves neither, but for another, much more might he wonder that the ſufferings &amp; labours of this life by which Chriſtians are to gain the Kingdom of Heaven, not for ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but for themſelves, ſhould ſeem ſo great and ſo grievous unto them, as they make appear by their unwillingneſs to undergoe the leaſt trouble for ſo great a purchaſe. But I muſt attribute their failings herein to their little eſtimate of ſo precious a Jewel;
<note place="margin">Propoſito ſibi gaudio ſuſtinuit crucem. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13 <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.</note> for had they known the value of it as well as others have done, they would bid for it, as they did; or at leaſt they would not paſs by ſo careleſly a thing which they ſought after ſo carefully.

This is my caſe; I am aſham'd to ſee my ſelf ſo remiſs in my duty to thee, ſo unwilling to undergo the leaſt trouble to purchaſe thy glory, and ſo heedleſs of my own ſalvation, when I ſee Heathens perform ſuch great and heroick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits even for the bare applauſe of the world, and for the blind approbation of their phantaſtical Sect. I am aſham'd to ſee my ſelf ſo remote from virtue, ſo cold in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, ſo prone to vice, ſo inconſtant in my good reſolutions, ſo averſs'd to afflictions and croſſes, when I hear a Pagan-Philoſopher that knows nothing of thy glory, nothing of the everlaſting happineſs of thy Kingdom, nothing of the unſpeakable reward of thy Bleſſed, and nothing of the eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which thou haſt decree'd for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tell me that there is not in the ſcale of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:151886:113"/>nature a more inſeparable connexion of cauſe and effect, then in the caſe of happineſs and virtue: nor any thing that more naturally produces the one, or more neceſſarily preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the other. For, what is it to be happy, but for a man to content himſelf with his lot, in a chearful and quiet reſignation to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of God? All the actions of our lives ought to be govern'd with a reſpect to good, and evil: and it is only Reaſon that diſtinguiſhes: by which reaſon we are in ſuch manner influenc'd as if a Ray of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity were dipt in a mortal body; and that's the perfection of mankinde. 'Tis true, we have not the eyes of Eagles nor the Sagacity of hounds, nor if we had, could we pretend to eſteem our ſelves for any thing which we have in common with Brutes. What are we the better for that which is foreign to us, and may be given, and taken away? As the Beams of the Sun irradiate the Earth, and yet remain where they were, ſo is it in ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with a holy minde, that illuſtrates all our actions, and yet adheres to it's Original. Why do we not as well commend a Horſe for his glorious Trapings, as a man for his pompous additions? how much a braver Creature is a Lyon (which by nature ought to be fierce, and terrible) how much braver (I ſay) he is in his natural horrour, then in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:151886:114"/>his chains? So that every thing in its pure nature pleaſes us beſt. It is not Health, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Riches, that can juſtify a wicked man; nor is it the want of all theſe can diſcredit a good one. That's the Sovereign Bleſſing, which makes the Profeſſor of it valuable without any thing elſe, and him that wants it contemptible, tho' he had all the world beſides. 'Tis not the painting, gilding, or carving that makes a good Ship; but if ſhe be a nimble Sailer, tight, and ſtrong, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Seas, that's her excellency. 'Tis the Edge and temper of the blade that makes a good Sword; not the richneſs of the Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard: 'Tis even the ſame with man, 'tis not money, or vaſt poſſeſſions, or eminent pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or great dignitys that makes him conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, but his virtue alone.</p>

               <p>There are two Republicks, a great one, which is humane nature; and a leſs, which is the place where we are born: ſome ſerve both at a time; ſome only the greater; and ſome again only the leſs: The greater may be ſerv'd in privacy, Solitude, contemplation, &amp; perchance that way better then any other: But it was th'intent of nature however, that we ſhould ſerve both. A good man may ſerve the Publick, his friend, and himſelf too, in any Station: If he be not for the Sword, let him take the Gown; if the Bar does not agree with him, let him try the Pulpit; If he be ſilenc'd abroad, let him give Counſel at home; and diſcharge the part of a faithful friend, and a Temperate companion. When he is no longer a Citizen, he is yet a man; the whole world is his Country, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature never wants matter to work upon: But, if nothing will ſerve a man in the civil Government, unleſs he be prime Miniſter; or in the Field, but to command in Chief, 'tis his own fault. The common
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:151886:115"/>Soldier, where he cann't uſe his hands, fights with his very looks; his example, his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, his voice: and ſtands his ground even when he has loſt his hands: and does ſervice too with his very clamour; ſo that in any condition whatſoever, he ſtill diſcharges the duty of a good Patriot. Nay, he that ſpends his time well, even in a retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gives a great example: we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large indeed, or contract, according to the circumſtances of time, place, or abilitys; but above all things, we muſt be ſure to keep our ſelves in action; for he that is ſloathful is dead even while he lives. All this is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, and to the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of all good Chriſtians, but alas! 'tis quite contrary to what I practiſe (to my ſhame be it ſpoken) and I much fear it will appear in judgment againſt me in that dreadful day of thy juſt indignation and wrath.</p>
               <p>O Lord! thou haſt made me a watch-man unto the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; haſt laid a ſtrict obligation on me to depreſs vice, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the growth thereof, within the precincts, of my Jurisdiction, as well by word, as by good examples; but alas! unfaithful, and cow-hearted wretch as I am, for fear of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Benefice, or incurring the diſpleaſure of great Perſons, of whom I depend for a livelyhood, I ſilence their faults, and wink
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:151886:115"/>at their debaucheries, which certainly will redound to my grand confuſion, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe that Pagans have acted other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Was there ever ſo deſperate a ſtate, as that of <hi>Athens</hi> under the thirty Tyrants; where it was capital to be honeſt; and the Senate-houſe turn'd into a Colledge of Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; never was government ſo wretched, and ſo hopeleſs; and yet <hi>Socrates</hi> at the ſame time preach'd Temperance to the Tyrants, and courage to the reſt: and afterwards dy'd an eminent example of manlineſs and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Sacrifice for the common good.</p>
               <p>'Tis not the part of a wiſeman, ſays ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pagan, to ſtand ſhifting, and fencing with fortune, but to oppoſe her bare-fac'd; for he is ſufficiently convinc'd, that ſhe can do him no hurt: ſhe may take away his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Poſſeſſions, Dignities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> She may aſſault his body, put out his eyes, cut off his hands, &amp; ſtrip him of all external comforts of life. But what does all this amount to, more then the recalling of a Truſt, which he has receiv'd, with condition to deliver it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain upon demand? He looks upon himſelf as precarious, and only lent to himſelf, and yet he does not value himſelf ever the leſs, becauſe he is not his own; but takes ſuch care as an honeſt man ſhould do of a thing that is committed to him in Truſt. Whenſoever He
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:151886:116"/>that lent me my ſelf, and what I have, ſhall call for all back again, 'tis not a loſs, but a reſtitution; and I muſt willingly deliver up what moſt undeſervedly was beſtow'd upon me; and it will become me to return my minde better then I receiv'd it. O my Soul! wouldſt thou not take this diſcourſe to be the products of a patient <hi>Job</hi> on his dunghil, in his mournful Addreſſes to God; or the expreſſions of ſome eminent and illuminate Saint in the deſert, rather then the words of an heathen Philoſopher; but what if thou ſeeſt this ſupereminent doctrine practis'd by another of the ſame Sect? will it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thy inſatiate deſire of Earthly riches, thy great neglect of thy own Salvation, and the little value thou putſt upon Heaven, and it's everlaſting pleaſures?</p>

                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> upon the taking of <hi>Megara,</hi> ask'd <hi>Stilpo</hi> the Philoſopher what he had loſt: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſays he, for I had all that I could call my own about me. And yet the enemy had then made himſelf the maſter of his Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, his Children, and his Country: But theſe he look'd upon only as adventitious goods, and under the command of Fortune: Now he that neither loſt any thing, nor fear'd any thing in a publick ruine, but was ſafe, and at peace, in the middle of the flames, and in the heat of a military intemperance and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:151886:116"/>fury; what violence, or provocation imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, can put ſuch a man as this out of the poſſeſſion of himſelf? Walls, and Caſtles may be min'd and batter'd; but there is no art, or Engin, that can ſubvert a ſteady minde: I have made my way (ſays <hi>Stilpo</hi>) through fire, and bloud; what is become of my Wife and Children, I know not; but they are tranſitory bleſſings &amp; Servants like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that are accuſtomed to change their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; what was my own before, is my own ſtill; ſome have loſt their Eſtates; others their dear bought Miſtreſſes; their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Offices; the Uſurers have loſt their Bonds and ſecurities; but, <hi>Demetrius,</hi> for my part, I have ſav'd all: &amp; do not imagine after all this, either that <hi>Demetrius</hi> is a conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or that <hi>Stilpo</hi> is overcome. 'Tis only thy fortune has been too hard for mine. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> took <hi>Babylon; Scipio</hi> took <hi>Carthage;</hi> the Capitol was burnt: but there's no fire or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that can diſcompoſe a generous minde: Some perhaps will take this Character for a Chimera; but they are groſsly miſtaken, for all ages afford ſome, tho not ſo many inſtances of this elevated virtue. A good man will do his duty let it be never ſo painful, ſo hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or never ſo great a loſs to him; and it is not all the money, the power; and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the world; no not any force, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:151886:117"/>that can make him wicked; Hear what the noble and daring <hi>Mathathias</hi> ſays in the open Streets of <hi>Maden,</hi>

               <p>The Philoſopher I but now ſpoke of, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother inſtance of it; I mean <hi>Stilpo,</hi> who, when he had loſt his Country, his Wife, his Children, the Town on fire above his head, himſelf ſcaping very hardly, and naked out of the flames, I have ſav'd my Goods ſays he, which are, my Juſtice, my Courage, my Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, my Prudence; ſhewing by this how much eaſier it was to overcome a Nation, then one Wiſe man. It is a certain mark of a brave minde (ſays another Pagan Philoſopher) not to be mov'd by any Accidents, and brings this Preſident to make good his argument: The upper Region of the Air admits neither clouds, nor Tempeſt,; the Thunder, Storms, and Meteors, are fram'd below; and this is the difference betwixt a mean, and an exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:151886:117"/>minde: The former is rude, and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary; the latter is modeſt, venerable, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and always quiet in his ſtation. In a word, it is the conſcience that pronounces upon the man whether he be happy or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Sacriledge and Adultery are generally condemn'd, yet how many are there ſtill that do not ſo much as bluſh at the one; and in truth, that take a glory in the other? There is nothing more common, then for great Thieves to ride in triumph, when the little ones are puniſh'd. But let wickedneſs ſcape as it may at the Bar, it never fails of doing Juſtice upon it ſelf; for every guilty perſon is his own hangman.</p>
               <p>O moſt gracious Saviour! the Godly feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the heroick exploits of theſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſophers have already ſo confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me that I have not a word to ſay in my own defence, and do very much apprehend that my confuſion will be far greater in the day of thy wrath, when they ſhall all appear as evidences againſt me, and Judge me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be their footſtool in Hell for an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to be trampled on,

               <p>The Holy Fathers, and Doctors of my Church, grounded upon my word, believe a variety of torments in Hell for the Damn'd, according to the variety of the Sins, which they had committed in their Life; for the Adulterer ſhall have one kinde of torment, the Murtherer another, the Thief another; the Drunkard another, the Lyer another; and the reſt accordingly.

Behold how cruelly he treats that Innocent and harmleſs <hi>Job,</hi> after he had conſum'd by fire all his ſheep, and his Servants, after he had taken away all his Cows, his Camels &amp; Aſſes, and ſlain their keepers, after he had beat down his houſes and Smother'd all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren under their ruines, he cover'd his body from head to foot with ſo loathſome an Ulcer, that he was an eye-ſore to his whole family, and caſt out upon a dunghill where he lay without any comfort, relief, or aſſiſtance from any friend or relation; ſo that he was forc'd himſelf to ſcrape off the worms and corruption that came from his wounds with a pot-ſheard. His poor body was ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd, and left ſo lean, that only ſo much fleſh remain'd about his lips, as might enable him to ſpeak and make anſwer: The night which brings ſome refreſhment and eaſe to the afflictions of others, augmented his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and increas'd his pains with moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:151886:129"/>apparitions; his Wife which ſhould be a great comfort to him in his deplorable ſtate and condition, was one of his greateſt plagues, for ſhe did both rail, and vilify him to that degree, as to tell him to his face that ſhe could not endure the noiſomeneſs of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifi'd body, and bid him to curſe God, and dye, like a rotten dog as he was.

O how they ſhall cry out, and roar, not for a day, or a month, or a year, but for an Eternity, which will never have an end. When a man poſſeſt with the opinion of proper merit, aims earneſtly at ſome eminent and vacant Dignity, and at length ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf neglected, and put off with ſhame, his Indignation and grief ſwells him up above meaſure; It is the ſame with thoſe damn'd Wretches, or rather worſe, for they ſhall be far more afflicted by the very Conſideration of thoſe unſpeakable goods, and Eternal Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities which they ſee themſelves have loſt, &amp; thoſe to enioy them, whom they reputed to be fools and mad-men, and far inferiour to them in wit, in learning, and merit; It's there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays, that their memory ſhall be one of their greateſt tormentors, for it will repreſent unto them all they have done good or bad in their lives; and both will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually perplex them: The good becauſe they have loſt their reward, and the bad, becauſe they have deſerv'd their puniſhment. It will likewiſe ſet before their eyes the delights and pleaſures which they had enjoy'd in this life, and for which they fell into that unſpeakable miſery; Theſe Conſiderations ſhall be to them, ſays St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> a ſharp Sword that ſhall pierce their hearts through, and make

What Mathematician (tho' never ſo learn'd) can perfectly confer the few, ſhort, and evil days of this life, with the eternal years, and Ages of the other; alas! the former is no more then a fleeting ſhaddow to the latter; what groans, what ſighs then will they belch out, when they ſee that thoſe delights, and pleaſures have continu'd but an inſtant, and that the pains they ſuffer for them ſhall be for Eternity; when they ſhall remember how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily they might have purchas'd Heaven, and avoided the grand misfortune &amp; anguiſhes of the damn'd. Then they will ſay with an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy heart, what favourable occaſions and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure had we to pray to God for a happy end of our lives, but alas, it was the leaſt of our thoughts, we have ſpent that precious time in play and vanitys, but now we pay dear for it; how often have we been courted to faſt for our ſins, and to appeaſe thereby the juſt indignation of God againſt us, but we have made nothing of ſuch good advices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo earneſt to ſatisfy our greedy appetites.

               <p>O Man thou ſpeakeſt extraordinary well of the exceſſive calamities which the damn'd do ſuffer in Hell! and thy words are ſufficient to move the moſt obdurate hearts, to imbrace the moſt ſevere and rigid auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that ever was practis'd by men in this world; for whoever conſiders ſeriouſly the Eternity of thoſe torments which the wicked do ſuffer in Hell, will never murmure at the pains of this ſhort life let them be never ſo bitter.

               <p>See what a penitent poſture <hi>Manaſſes</hi> had put himſelf in after his converſion, behold how he groans under the burden of his Sins, and how he laments his iniquities with ſuch a ſorrow, that he acknowledg'd himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy even to lift up his eyes towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo great, he confeſs'd were his offences, that he was rather deſerving of Hell, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny favour at my hands; hear his words, and thou ſhalt believe them to be the products of a truly penitent Soul? 'Tis true ſays he, O Lord! I have infinitely offended thee, and my Sins are more in number then the Sand of the Sea; I am unworthy to lift up my eyes towards Heaven to demand thy mercy. I have Sinned, O my God, I have Sinned: I acknowledge all the evil I have done, pardon, O Lord pardon, I beg of thee, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſeech thee, do not deſtroy me with my iniquities; do not reſerve me to the utmoſt

Turn from us thy anger; hear O Lord, our prayers, and our petitions; open thy eyes and conſider that the dead praiſe thee not, but the Soul which is ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and afflicted with the greatneſs of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils done, and performs due pennance for them.

               <p>MOſt merciful Redeemer, that it is an unfortunate Place repleniſh'd with miſeries, none can doubt, becauſe thou O God haſt ſaid it. And it is in the opinion of the chiefeſt of thy Prophets, a Land of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and burning pitch, a Land of Peſtilence and corruption: a Land of uncleanneſs and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:151886:136"/>miſery; and no wonder it ſhould be call'd ſo, being the Angelical Doctor St. <hi>Thomas</hi> avers, that all the moſt naſty droſs and dregs, as well of the Earth, as of the other elements ſhall be caſt down into Hell, for the greater puniſhment of the Damn'd, and the reaſon he gives for it, is, that as every Creature does contribute to the joy of the Bleſſed, ſo every creature likewiſe ſhall add unto the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the damn'd; and as they have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated themſelves by ſin from thee, who art One, and plac'd their happineſs only in the Creatures, they ſhall alſo receive their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Creatures in this common ſhore, &amp; Layſtal of all the Elements; O what a dreadful Dungeon! what a lamentable place of Baniſhment will this be to thoſe Damn'd Wretches! What I have to ſay of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s joyful admiration, is, If men be thus tranſported with the difference betwixt ſome Countrys and others, betwixt the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of ſome Men, and thoſe of others, what difference ſhall the damn'd Souls finde betwixt Heaven and Hell, betwixt the joy of the one, and the torments of the other, and betwixt the converſation of Angels, and that of the Devils? What grief will it be to them to behold themſelves everlaſtingly baniſh'd from Heaven, depriv'd of thy viſion, ejected from the company of Angels, from the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:151886:137"/>of Saints, and out of that happy Land of the living, where all is in peace, quietneſs, Charity, Joy; where all ſhines, all pleaſes, and all parts reſound with <hi>Alleluia's.</hi> I am now to conſider with what cruelty the Devil treats thoſe wretches in that woful land of their Baniſhment; but before I enter upon this matter, it will not be amiſs to entertain you with the cruelty of Mortals one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by which we may eaſily conclude how outragiouſly cruel the Devil will be to all men, that ſhall be ſo unhappy as to fall into his Clutches, for he is their profeſſed Enemy even from their Creation.</p>
               <p>It would be more then ſufficient matter for a larger Volume then this, to treat of the miſerable conſequences, &amp; ſanguinary effects of mens Rage and malice one to th'other; from hence proceed ſlaughters, poiſons, Wars, Deſolation, raſing, and burning of Cities; unpeopling of Nations, turning of populous Countrys into Deſarts; publick Maſſacres, Regicids, Kings abdicated, Princes led in Triumph; ſome murther'd in their bed-chambers; others Stab'd in the Senate, or cut off in the ſecurity of their ſpectacles, and pleaſures. Some were that took their paſſion for a Princely quality; as <hi>Darius,</hi> who in his expedition againſt the <hi>Scythians,</hi> being deſir'd by a Noble-man, that had three
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:151886:137"/>Sons, that he would vouchſafe to accept of two of them into his Service, and leave the third at home for a comfort to his Father. I will do more for you then that, ſays <hi>Darius,</hi> for you ſhall have them all three again: So he order'd them to be ſlain before his face and left him their bodys. <hi>Xerxes</hi> dealt not much better with <hi>Pythius,</hi> who had five Sons and deſir'd only one of them for himſelf. <hi>Xerxes</hi> bad him to take his choice, and he claim'd the Eldeſt, whom he immediately commanded to be cut in halves; and one half of the body to be laid on each ſide of the way where his Army was to paſs, that they might march betwixt them: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a moſt inauſpicious Sacrifice, for He came to the end that he deſerv'd, and liv'd to ſee that prodigious Power Scatter'd, and broken, and inſtead of Military and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Troops, to be compaſs'd with dead Carcaſes.</p>
               <p>But theſe you'l ſay, were only barbarous Princes, that knew neither civility, nor let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: And theſe Savage crueltys will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted perchance to their rudeneſs of manners, and want of Diſcipline. But what if <hi>Alexander the great,</hi> that was train'd up under the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution even of the Prince of Philoſophers, ſhould be guilty of an action altogether as barbarous? did he not kill <hi>Clytus</hi> his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:151886:138"/>and School-fellow with his own hand, under his own Roof, and over the freedom of a Cup of Wine? And what was his Crime? He was loth to degenerate from a <hi>Macedonian</hi> liberty into a <hi>Perſian</hi>-Slavery, that is to ſay, He could not flatter. <hi>Lyſimacus,</hi> another of his friends he expos'd to a Lyon, and glad would he have been to have had nails and teeth to have devour'd him himſelf. It would have too much derogated he thought, from the dignity of his wrath, to have appointed a man for the execution of his friend. And this very <hi>Lyſimacus</hi> after he had eſcap'd this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; was never the more merciful, when he came to reign himſelf; for he cut off the ears and noſe of his friend. <hi>Teleſphorus,</hi> and when he had ſo disfigured him, that he had no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the face of a man, he threw him into a Dungeon, and there kept him to be ſhew'd for a Monſter, &amp; as a ſtrange ſight. The place was ſo low, that he was fain to creep upon all four, and his ſides were gall'd too with the ſtraitneſs of it. In this miſery he lay half famiſh'd in his own filth: ſo odious, ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, and ſo loathſome a ſpectacle, that the horrour of his condition had even extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd all pity for him. Nothing was ever ſo unlike a man, as the poor wretch that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd this, ſaving the cruel Tryant that acted it. But what is all this to the cruelty and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:151886:138"/>which the Devil ſhall exerciſe upon the Souls and Bodies of his infernal Caitiſs.

The holy Scripture ſays, that the damn'd ſhall be ſo ſtraitned and crowded together in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall Dungeon that they may be very well compar'd to grapes in the wine-preſs, which do preſs one another until they burſt; That their Souls ſhall ſwim in the middle of a moſt dreadful Lake of fire like fiſhes in the Sea,

                  <hi>Teleſphorus</hi> was caſt into a deep Dungeon without cloths, expos'd to the inclemency of the cold and moiſture of the place where he could not ſee the light of Heaven, or have any thing to feed upon, but once in four and twenty hours a little piece of hard barly bread, and a little water to drink, where he was to continue all his life without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſeeing any body, and no other beel
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:151886:139"/>to ſleep upon but the cold, noiſom, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ground, up to his navel in his own dung; O what a miſery this was! certainly one weeks lodging there, would appear longer then a hundred years elſewhere. Yet if we compare this with that baniſhment and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Hell, we ſhall finde the miſery of this man to be a main happineſs in regard of that which the damn'd ſuffer in their dark and dreadful habitation: In his troubles he met with none ſo hard-hearted as to Scoff and jeſt at his misfortunes, none to torment and whip him, but in Hell they ſhall finde both; for the Devils ſhall never ceaſe to deride, whip, and torment them moſt cruelly. There he had no horrid ſights, no fearful noiſes of how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, groanings, &amp; lamentations; but in Hell the eyes and ears of the damn'd ſhall never be free from all thoſe diſtaſters. There he had no flames of fire to ſcorch him, but in Hell they ſhall burn even into the very bowels. There he might move and turn from one ſide to the other; But in Hell they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſtir out of the place, nor change their poſture to give themſelves the leaſt eaſe. There he might breath now and then ſome little freſh Air; but in hell they ſhall ſuck in nothing but flames, ſtink and Sulpher. There he might have ſome hopes of releaſe after the Tyrant's death, but in Hell they
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:151886:139"/>have no expectation of goal-delivery, no hope of being ever redeem'd. There the leaſt peice of hard bread would ſeem to him every day a fine Regale, but in Hell for an Eternity they ſhall not behold a crumb of bread, nor a drop of water, but ſhall eternally rage with a dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like hunger, and a burning thirſt. This is the grand calamity of that Land of darkneſs: bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of all things, but of the brambles and thorns of grief and torments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> would commonly, for exerciſe and pleaſure, put Senators, and Roman Knights to the torture: and whip ſeveral of them like ſlaves, or put them to death with the moſt accurate torments, meerly for the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his cruelty. That <hi>Caeſar</hi> who wiſh'd the People of <hi>Rome</hi> had all but one neck, that he might cut it off at one blow. Cruelty was the imployment, the Study, and the Joy of his life. He would not ſo much as give the expiring leave to groan, but caus'd their mouths to be ſtop'd with ſpunges, or for want of them with rags of their own cloths, that they might not breath out ſo much as their laſt Agonies at liberty; nay, he was ſo impatient of delay, that he would frequently riſe from Supper to have men kill'd by torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; as if his life and death had depended upon their diſpatch before the next morning. To ſay nothing how many Fathers were put
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:151886:140"/>to death by him in the ſame night with their Sons (which was a kinde of mercy, in the preventing of their mourning.) And was not <hi>Sylla's</hi> cruelty prodigious too, which was only ſtop'd for want of Enemies? He caus'd ſeven thouſand Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> to be ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd at once; and ſome of the Senators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtartled at their crys that were heard in the Senat-houſe: let us minde our buſineſs, ſays <hi>Sylla,</hi> this is nothing but a few Mutineers that I have order'd to be ſent out of the way. A glorious Spectacle! ſays <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when he ſaw the Trenches flowing with humane blood; and if the rivers had run blood too, would hav lik'd it ſo much the better.</p>
               <p>O moſt gracious Saviour! how couldſt thou ſuffer ſuch monſters of nature to live upon Earth, or how came it that the ground did not ſwallow them into it's bowels? But alas! why ſhould I admire ſuch cruelty among men, being they were ſet on by the Devil, who has been always a moſt cruel Tyrant to Mankind, but eſpecially when they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd over into his power: We are amaz'd to hear of ſuch unhumame and barbarous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; we are aſtoniſh'd to think of that hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh invention of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> to roſte men alive in his braſen Bull; But alas! all theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and bloudy ſlaughters are meer toys in reſpect of what is exercis'd in Hell; for
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:151886:140"/>the torments there are ſo great that they can't be expreſs'd, and no wonder; being that the only pain of fire comprizes as many tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as the body of man has Limbs, Joynts, Sinews, Arteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and eſpecially being caus'd by ſo penetrating a fire; in reſpect of which our temporal fire (tho' it were made of all the combuſtible matter in the world) is no more then a painted fire: And in thoſe flames of Hell the Souls of the damn'd muſt burn not for an hour, nor a year,

All this being punctually, and ſpeedily perform'd, the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made a ſpeech to his Officers, to let them know that this worthy Perſon, after he had entertain'd himſelf in Tilting, and the like atchievements of valour, and gallantry, was accuſtom'd to refreſh his weari'd limbs with

               <p>Thou ſhalt finde ſeveral proofs to confirm this aſſertion in the firſt Sermon I preach'd immediately after I was baptiz'd, there ſhalt thou hear me recommend,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.4</note> and extoll the great advantages of a virtuous life, of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, Meekneſs, Juſtice, Purity, Sorrow for Sin, patience in ſuffering, contempt of Riches, forgiving of injuries, Faſting, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Pennance, Entring by the ſtraight gate, and alſo of perfection, Holyneſs, Integrity of life and converſation, and of the exact ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of every particular of my Heavenly Fathers Laws, and Commandments. There thou ſhalt hear me ſay, I came not to the World to break the Law, but to fulfill the ſame; and whoſoever ſhall offer to break the leaſt of them, and bring others either by his ill example, or by his erroneous doctrine to do the like, ſhould have no place in the Kingdom of Heaven. There thou mayſt hear me ſay to all Chriſtians, except their Juſtice did exceed that of the Scribes and Phariſees, (which was altogether in words, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance) they could not be ſaved. That they might not ſerve two Maſters in
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:151886:145"/>this life, but either muſt forſake God, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon Mammon. That they ſhould decline from falſe Prophets that uſually come in ſheep's clothing, but are no better then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous Wolves in their hearts; and that all men ſhould ſeek to enter by the ſtraight gate; but the concluſion of my long Sermon is, that the only ſign and token of a good Tree, is the good fruit which it bears, and without this fruit, let the Tree be never ſo fair or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the eye, yet it is to be cut down and burnt; that 'tis not every one that ſhall cry Lord, Lord, at the laſt day, ſhall be ſav'd, or enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but only ſuch as did execute really, and in Deeds, the Will and commandments of my Father in this life. Where is there any incouragement here for the wicked to delay their converſion, or to put it off till the hour of death, in hopes of a good <hi>Peccavi?</hi> I ſee none, for they are all moſt preſſing motives to force them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of their iniquity into a virtuous and godly life. To be the better convinc'd of this undeniable truth, thou muſt know that life is a time, and ſeaſon of ſowing, and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeed of virtue, and the bitter roots of mortifications and pennance; and that Death is Harveſt time to reap the main pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of that happy Seed, and the wonderful ſweetneſs of thoſe bitter roots; It's therefore

We have ſpent that precious ſeaſon in all manner of vices, and now that the Harveſt is paſt, we muſt appear naked, as we are, of all good works, repleniſh'd with evil ones, before a dreadful Judge, to be ſentenc'd to Eternal Death, which We have juſtly deſerv'd for abuſing his mercy, by flattering our ſelves with a good <hi>Peccavi,</hi> at our laſt farewell to

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:151886:147"/>a maxim receiv'd among ye, that the Coppy muſt be like unto the Original; what is life? It's an Original, and what is Death? It's a Coppy; why then ſuch muſt be the Coppy, as was the Original; if the Original was a good and virtuous life, the Coppy muſt be a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Godly Death; but if the Original was totally a Scandalous, vicious, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd life, by all means the Coppy muſt be the death of a Reprobate. Thou mayſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd hereof even by very nature, for if thou ſpeak'ſt aloud near any Rock, or hollow-place, the Eccho will ſound diſtinctly every word thou haſt ſaid; If I ſet the ſame <hi>Tertullian</hi> the queſtion, what is life; he will anſwer, that it is a voice, and that death is the Eccho there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; then whatever the life pronounces, death will repeat it; If virtue, virtue; If vice, vice; If the fear of God, the fear of God; If the neglect of Salvation, and the contempt of Gods Commands, certainly death will repeat the ſelf ſame thing, ſo that it is the greateſt folly in nature to lead a wicked life, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a good <hi>Peccavi</hi> in the hour of death, which is as ſeldom granted to ſuch perſons as a <hi>Phaenix</hi> is ſeen in the World. There's another maxim in great requeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your Philoſophers which I do mightily approve of, by reaſon of it's truth, that a part is of the ſame nature with the thing

               <p>NO man can be grateful to thee O Lord! without contemning thoſe things that put the common People out of their wits. We muſt go into baniſhment they cry, we muſt lay down our lives; hate the World, and all its allurements; begger, and expoſe our ſelves to reproaches; nay 'tis often ſeen, that gratitude ſuffers the puniſhment due to Malefactors; and that Ingratitude receives the rewards of fidelity. As thy benefits are many, and great, ſo are the hazards of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which is the caſe, more or leſs, of all other virtues; and it were hard, if this, above all the reſt, ſhould be both painful and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: So that tho' we may go currently on
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:151886:152"/>with it in ſmooth way, we muſt yet prepare, and reſolve (if need be) to force through all to't, even if the way were cover'd with thorns, and Serpents; and, fall back, fall edge, we muſt be gratefull ſtill. Grateful for thy ſake, O Lord, and grateful likewiſe for our own peculiar Intereſt, for it preſerves thy favours, and gains us a new addition of greater.</p>
               <p>When I ſpeak in the praiſe of gratitude, I pleade the cauſe both of God and man, for, without it, we can neither be Sociable, nor religious. There's a ſtrange delight in the very purpoſe, and contemplation of it, as well as in the action; when I can ſay to my ſelf, I love my Benefactor; what is there in this world that I would not do to oblige &amp; ſerve him? Where I have not the means of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital, the very meditation of it is ſufficient. A man is never the leſs an Artiſt, for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his tools about him; or a muſitian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wants his Fiddle: nor is he the leſs brave, becauſe his hands are bound; or the worſe Pilot, for being upon dry ground. If I have only a will to be grateful, and the heart to perſever, I am ſo, and that's all thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireſt O Lord! Let me be upon the wheel; or under the hand of the Executioner; let me be burnt limb by limb, and my whole body dropping in the flames, a good Conſcience
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:151886:153"/>ſupports me in all extreams: nay, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable even in death it ſelf: for when we come to approach that point, what care do we take to ſummon, and call to minde all our Benefactors, and the good offices they have done us, that we may leave the world fairly, and ſet our minds in order, this is the bare duty of good nature, and what common civility requires of us, how much greater then muſt our care be to remember all the graces, and favours which We have receiv'd at thy hands O Lord, and to be grateful to thee accordingly; or if we can't return thee thanks equal to the benefits which thou wert pleas'd to confer upon us, let us at leaſt be grateful to thee ſo far, as not to ſerve another Maſter, for whom thou haſt an abhorrence, as being quite contrary to thy divine Maxims.</p>
               <p>I have already produc'd ſufficient motives, and reaſons to breed in our hearts a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World, ſo odious to God, and ſo deſtructive of our own Salvation; I have endeavoured as much as I could, to wean our affections from it, and from all it's pelf, as well for being in themſelves vile, tranſitory, mutable, inconſiderable, and dangerous; as for the frequent Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we have had from thee, O Lord! to hate, deſpiſe, and conſider them as the mortal Enemys of our Salvation. I will now add
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:151886:153"/>this one reaſon, that tho' the World and all its pleaſures and treaſures were real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and of that great eſtimate (as we make them) yet we ſhould not love them, becauſe that thy love O God, ſhould repleniſh our hearts to that degree, as to leave no place for any terrene or carnal affection.</p>
               <p>It was thy command, O Lord! to the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that they ſhould love thee with all their heart, with all their Soul, and with all their powers, tho' they were not ſo much oblig'd to thee, as we are, having receiv'd more favours and graces at thy hands then ever they did; and having alſo more knowledge of thy goodneſs then they could ever attain to; how then can we in gratitude admit of any other love? How can we caſt our eyes, or ſet our hearts upon the creature, when, (had each of us a million of hearts) we ſhould in juſtice conſecrate 'em all unto thee? There's not a motive for which thou art amiable but deſerves a thouſand wills, a thouſand loves, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand lives, all what we are, and all what we have, or can prtend to in this World; But if we look upon all the titles and motives of love which I have already ſpoke of, and for which we are indeſpenſably oblig'd to love thee, how can we in good Conſcience, love any thing beſides thee? If we conſider
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:151886:154"/>ſeriouſly the multitude of thy benefits, and the products of thy infinite love, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us, we ſhall be oblig'd to confeſs that, had we as many hearts as there are grains of Sand upon the Sea-ſhore, or Atoms in the air, all would not be capable to contain that great love which we owe unto thee; how then can I divide this one heart, which I have from thee, amongſt ſo many Creatures? and yet this is a plague that follows all mankinde, 'tis an evil that runs in the blood of all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, 'tis the higheſt of Ingratitude, which is the common diſtemper of this corrupt Age we live in; for ſome are ungrateful to their Country, and their Country no leſs ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to others; ſo that the complaint of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude reaches all Men: Does not the Son wiſh for the death of his Father? the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band for that of his Wife? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But who can expect to finde gratitude in an age of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gaping, and craving Appetites, where all People take, and none give? In an Age of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to all ſorts of vanity, and wickedneſs; as Luſt, Gluttony, Avarice, Envy, Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Sloth, Inſolence, Levity, Contumacy, Fear, Raſhneſs, private Diſcords, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Evils, extravagant and groundleſs wiſhes, vain Confidence, ſickly affections, ſhameleſs Impiety, Rapine authoriz'd, and the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things Sacred, and prophane Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:151886:154"/>are purſu'd with Sword and Poiſon: Benefits are turn'd into Crimes; and that blood moſt ſeditiouſly ſpilt, for which every honeſt man ſhould expoſe his own. Thoſe that ſhould be the preſervers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are the deſtroyers of it; and 'tis matter of dignity to trample upon the Government; the Sword gives the Law, and Mercenaries take up arms againſt their Maſters. Among theſe turbulent, and unruly motions, what hope is there of finding honeſty, or good Faith, which is the life of all virtues? there is not a more lively Image of humane life, then that of a conquer'd City: There is neither Mercy, Modeſty, nor Religion; and if we forget our lives, we may well forget the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations we have to thee and all thy benefits too.</p>
               <p>But let us conſider ſeriouſly the multitude and greatneſs of thy divine bleſſings, &amp; deal with thee even as one man does with another. The wiſe man ſays, that gifts break Rocks,
<note place="margin">Victoriam &amp; hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit qui dat munera; animam autem au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientium. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.9.</note> and ſhall not thy divine benefits move a heart of fleſh? and if they can ſteal the hearts of the receivers (according to <hi>Solomon</hi>) how come we not to be rob'd of our Souls by thee O Lord! For thou doſt not only give us thy gifts, but alſo doſt beſtow thy ſelf upon us as a moſt precious treaſure. If we conſider the benefits which we have receiv'd from thee in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:151886:155"/>our Creation, they are as many as we have members of our bodys, and faculties of our Souls; If thoſe of our Conſervation, they are equal in number to the diſtinct natures in Heaven and on Earth. The Elements, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, and the whole World were created for our preſervation, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them we could not ſubſiſt; If we look upon the benefits of our Redemption, We ſhall be eaſily convinc'd, that they are as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as there are evils in Hell, from which we are happily deliver'd by thy Paſſion, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal effuſion of thy moſt precious bloud. Thoſe of our Juſtification are no leſs in number then are the Sacraments, which thou haſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to increaſe our Merits, and work the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of our Souls; then the Graces and Inſpirations which thou doſt ſhower down into our hearts, and the divine Examples which thou haſt left us,
<note place="margin">Nonne haec op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuit Chriſtum pati &amp; ita intrare in gloriam ſuam. <hi>Luc.</hi> 24.26.</note> &amp; which ſhould invite us all to tread with a maſculine courage in the ſame paths which brought thee O Lord, into thine own glory. All theſe with thouſands of other benefits and obligations which we have receiv'd from thee, and by thy Creatures, cry out unto us to love thee with all our heart, with all our Soul, with all our Powers, and to trample under our feet this falſe World, with all it's vanitys, trifles, &amp; tranſitory plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. But alas! We make nothing of all thy
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:151886:155"/>benefits, We give no ear to all their crys, but rather, will love the World and taſt of its pleaſures in as ample a meaſure as our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes will afford us, wherein we ſeem to be worſe then even the very Heathens; for <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> tho' he was reputed to be one of the greateſt Men of <hi>Athens,</hi> yet he was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd to the Pomp and toys of the World, and ſo affected to poverty, that he always wore a courſe broken garment, ſuffer'd Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Cold, and Thirſt, not for any want of means, or friends to relieve him, but meerly for his own fancy; <hi>Zeno</hi> was nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd when news was brought to him, that he had loſt all what he had in the World; When <hi>An xagoras</hi> receiv'd the like news, he ſaid no more then, if my Goods had not periſh'd, I had been undone. <hi>Crates</hi> flung his whole ſubſtance into the Sea, with this expreſſion, It is better I drown you, then you me. <hi>Diogenes</hi> bid adieu to all he had in the World, and took nothing with him but a wooden diſh, and ſeeing by chance one drink out of the hollow of his hand, broke that alſo. And ſhall we refuſe to do in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to thy Commands, O Lord, &amp; for the purchaſe of an eternal weight of glory, what they freely, and gladly perform'd to pleaſure their own fancies, and gain the repute of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Philoſophers?

This was the greateſt care that <hi>David</hi> took, and the ſole ſubject of his moſt ſerious conſideration, what ſhall I return unto the Lord for all the favours which he has confirm'd upon me? But O bleſſed King and Prophet give me leave to ask thee what are thoſe favours? 'Tis true he has rais'd thee from the Station of a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd to the dignity of a King, He has enabl'd thee to encounter a Giant, and to get the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of him too, He has often protected thee againſt the evil Spirit of <hi>Saul,</hi> and has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd thy life from all the wicked and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous attempts he made to deſtroy thee; theſe are great obligations indeed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thy grateful return; but are nothing to the benefits which we have receiv'd at his hands; his love for us was ſo great that he ſuffer'd death to bring us to life everlaſting; and left unto us for food to our Souls, his moſt precious body and blood; certainly theſe obligations are unſpeakable, and deſerve at leaſt that ſmall attonement of returning back unto him our Souls, hearts, and bodys; for as we had them from him, 'tis our weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:151886:156"/>obligation to let him have them again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, and free from any love-to the World, or affection to the Creatures; ſo that We are to account our ſelves now and evermore, as only his, and not our own; conſequently, We are not to debaſe our love by placing it upon any worldly object, but to ſettle it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him alone.</p>
               <p>And really if we conſider ſeriouſly the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love which thou haſt for us, O Lord, We ſhall finde that we have no love left to beſtow either upon the World, or any ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene object, no, nor upon our ſelves; for We muſt know that love conſiſts in action, and the more it acts or ſuffers, the greater is the perfection thereof; how great then muſt thy love be O Lord, being thou haſt wrought ſuch Stupendious works for our Salvation, &amp; ſtill doſt continue to work the like for our preſervation; the Sun, the Moon,

               <p>O Man! thou muſt never repute him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py that depends upon the World for his happineſs; for nothing can be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous then to place the good of a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature in unreaſonable things, and yet as it is a common miſtake to account thoſe neceſſary that are ſuperfluous, ſo it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as common with men to depend upon the World for the felicity of life, which ariſes only from virtue. There is no truſting to its ſmiles, no more then there is to a calme at Sea, which will ſwell and rage in a moment, ſo that the Ships are ſwallow'd up at night, in the very place where they ſported themſelves in

The world has the ſame power over Princes, that it has over Empires; over Nations, that it has over Cities; and the ſame power over Cities, that it has over private men. Where's that Eſtate that may not be follow'd upon the heel with Famine, and Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery?

The terror of it muſt needs be great, for the calamity is almoſt without example. If it had been fir'd by an Enemy, the flame would have left ſome far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchief to be done by the Soldiers; but to be wholly conſum'd, was a prodigious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident! and perhaps an Earthquake ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious as that, was never heard of: ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rarities to be deſtroy'd in one night; and in a profound peace to ſuffer an outrage beyond the extremity of war, who would believe it? but twelve hours betwixt of fair a City and none at all: It was laid in aſhes in leſs time then it would require to tell the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. That the Inhabitants ſhould ſtand unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſuch a calamity is hardly to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and their wonder could not but be equal
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:151886:159"/>to their grief. This diſmal accident ſhould teach all men to provide againſt the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that fall within the Power of ſo cruel an Enemy, as is the World; for this Tyrant having all external things under his dominion will ſometimes ſmile at poor Silly Mortals, &amp; invite them to taſt of his pleaſures, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother while, he will turn them off with a frown, and deſtroy them with miſchiefs whereof they are to ſeek for the Author. No time, place, or condition is excepted from his Tyranny; he makes their very pleaſures painful to them, and makes War upon them in the depth of Peace; he turns the means of their Security into an occaſion of fear: he turns a Friend into an Enemy, and makes a mortal Foe of a deer Companion: his Slaves ſhall be ſure to ſuffer the effects of War with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Adverſary; and rather then fail, even their felicity ſhall be the fatal cauſe of their utter deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Leſt they ſhould either forget, or neglect his power; every day produces ſomething extraordinary. He perſecutes the moſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate with ſickneſs; the ſtrongeſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Ptiſick; he brings the Innocent to puniſhment, and the moſt retir'd he aſſaults with tumults. Thoſe Glorys which have grown up with many Ages, with infinit labour, and expence, and under the favour

He that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd a day, nay an hour ſufficient for the deſtruction of the greateſt Empire, might have fallen to a moment. It were ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort yet to the frailty of mankind, and of humane affairs, if things might but decay as ſlowly as they riſe, but they grow by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and they fall to ruine in an Inſtant. There is no true felicity to be expected from the World in either private or publick affairs. Men, Nations, and Citys have all their fates, and periods: Their very entertainments are not without terror, and their calamity riſes where they leaſt expected it. Thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes which ſtood the ſhock both of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Wars, and Civil, come to deſtruction without the ſight of an Enemy. A man may be ſafe to day, and happy in the love of his Country, but to morrow he may be in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and caſt either into Priſon, or Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: To day, in pleaſure, peace, health; to morrow broken upon the wheel; led in Triumph one day, and the next in the Agony of a mortal Sickneſs. What the World gives this day, he may take the next; and he that truſts to his favours, ſhall either finde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deceiv'd or if he be not, he will at leaſt be troubl'd becauſe he has but fallible means to depend upon. He throws his gifts among
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:151886:160"/>his ſlaves, and they (ſilly Souls) ſweat and ſcuffle for them; never conſidering how few are the better for that which was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all. Some are tranſported with what they get; others tormented for what they miſs, and many times there's a Leg or an Arm broken, or a man killed in a conteſt for a thing of no more value then a counter. He gives them Honours, Riches, &amp; Favours, only to take them away again; either by violence, or treachery, ſo that they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return to the damage of the receivers. He throws out baits for them, and ſets traps, as they do for Birds and Beaſts; his bountys are ſnares, and Limetwigs to them; They (poor Souls) think they have taken a great prize, but they are themſelves taken. If what Riches, Pleaſures, or Dignitys the World gives had any thing in them that were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, they would ſome time or other fill, and quiet the receivers; but they ſerve only to provoke their Appetite, without any thing to allay it, unleſs Pomp, and oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>In fine,</hi> this I conclude upon; that the Empire of the World is but imaginary, and that whoſoever ſerves it, makes himſelf a voluntary ſlave; the beſt, and ſafeſt courſe that men can take to exempt themſelves from the tyranny and ſlavery thereof, is to be neither dejected with his injurys, nor dazl'd
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:151886:160"/>with his flattery, and favours. When <hi>Zeno</hi> was told that all his ſubſtance was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; why then, ſays he, the World has a mind to make me a Philoſopher. 'Tis a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a man to advance his minde above his threats, or flatteries; for he that has once got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the better of him, is ſafo for ever; and to come to this point, all mortals ſhould follow the dictates of the Wiſe, for the things that are always contemn'd by them, are really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable, and vain in themſelves.</p>

All the Potentates and crown'd Heads of the Earth thought themſelves happy for ever, had they but the Honour to behold his Face, to hear him ſpeak, and be eye-witneſſes of his wiſdom and renown'd felicity. The Riches, the Pleaſures, &amp; treaſures of all other Princes, (were they all collected in a heap) would be nothing to his: for he had yearly Six hundred Sixty Six Talents of Gold, beſide what Tribute he had pai'd unto him anually by the Kings of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and other Princes: As for Silver, it was as plentiful with him,
<note place="margin">3 <hi>Reg.</hi> 4.</note> as Stones are with the Mountaineers: his Plate and Jewells were without number: His Throne was ſupported with ſeveral figures
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:151886:161"/>of Lions, and other Beaſts, all made of maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive gold. His Apparel and Armour were as precious, as they were numerous; he had all the Kings, from the Philiſtines River unto <hi>Egipt</hi> at his beck to ſerve him when ever he had occaſion to command them. He had forty thouſand Saddle-horſes in his Stables,

He had two hundred Spears all of Gold, each valu'd at ſix hundred Crowns in gold, and three hundred bucklers guilt each with three hundred crowns of gold. He had every day ſpent in his houſe one thouſand nine hundred thirty and ſeven Quarters of Meal and Flower; thirty Oxen with an hundred Wethers, beſides all ſorts of Foul and Veniſon to a vaſt quantity, He had ſeven hundred Wives that were his Queens, and three hundred Concubines beſides: yet after all this Earthly Wealth, Pleaſures, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and even what his heart could deſire, this was his feeling of them, <hi>vanitas vanitatum, &amp; omnia vanitas:</hi>

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:151886:161"/>by my wiſdom to ſeek out the nature of all things, and have ſeen, that all under the Sun, are meer vanitys and affliction of Spirit. I ſaid in my heart,

<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> I took great works in hand, made great Palaces, Sumptuous Houſes, coſtly Stables, Strong Towers, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Ramparts, vaſt Vineyards, delicate Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens ful of fine Flours and all ſorts of herbs that can be nam'd, great Orchards planted with all kinde of Trees: I made my Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds to water my Trees: I had a great train of Servants Men and Women, and a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Family, great herds of Cattle far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all that ever my Predeceſſors were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> I brought into my own Treaſury the Gold and Silver, the Riches and Jewels of all my neighbouring Kings and Princes. I had a vaſt number of Muſicians and Singers, both of Men and Women, wherein the Children of men do place their chiefeſt delight. I had a great many artificial curious and coſtly Cups to drink Wine; <hi>In fine</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things my Eyes and Heart could fancy, it was out of hand provided for them, I did never reſtrain them from taking their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fures: But when I came to reflect ſeriouſly with my ſelf upon all my actions, and works
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:151886:162"/>wherein I had taken ſo much labour and toil both in minde and body; I made this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion and firmly believe that all was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and affliction of minde. <hi>Job</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a moſt wiſe and holy man,

His ſubſtance was ſeven thouſand ſheep, three hundred Camels, five hundred yoke of Oxen, five hundred ſhe-Aſſes, a vaſt treaſure of Gold and Silver, abundance of Plate, and Houſhold-ſtuff, a numeroms Family; <hi>In fine,</hi> he was the richeſt and moſt powerful of all the Men of the Eaſt, yet in a moment he was made the pooreſt, and the moſt afflicted of all mankinde. He was reduc'd to that extremity, that his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Friends would not abide the ſight of him; thus was he caſt out of doors, and forc'd to lye upon a dunghil; where he makes this ſad complaint, which is enough to breed in the hearts of all mankinde a continual abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the World, and all its allurements. How long, ſays he, to his falſe and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Friends, will ye vex my Soul, and break me in peices with words? Theſe ten times have ye reproached me: You are not aſham'd that you make your ſelves ſtrange to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:151886:162"/>me. And be it indeed that I have err'd, mine errour remains with my ſelf. If indeed ye will magnify your ſelves againſt me, and plead againſt me my reproach: Know now that God has permitted the World, and the Devil to overthrow me, and compaſs me with their nets. Behold I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard; I cry out aloud, but there's no Judgment. They have fenc'd up my way that I can't paſs, and have ſet dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in my paths. They have ſtript me of all my ſubſtance wherein I glori'd, and have taken the Crown from my head; They have alſo deſtroy'd me on every ſide, and have put my Brethren far from me, and made my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance even eſtranged from me; ſo that my Relations have fail'd me, and my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Friends have forgotten me. They that dwell in my houſe Ridicule me, and my maids count me for a Stranger, I am an Alien in their ſight. I call'd my Servant, and he gave me no anſwer; I entreated him with as much humility as poſſible, and he rebuk'd me. My Breath is loathſome to my Wife, and tho' I intreated her for the Childrens ſake begotten of my body, yet ſhe would not come near me. Nay, even young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren deſpiſe me; I aroſe and they ſpake againſt me. All my inward Friends abhorr'd me; and they whom I lov'd, are turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:151886:163"/>me. O man! can there be a greater motive to hate and abhor the World, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it's pleaſures, to make nothing of it's allurements, and never to confide, or place any truſt in it's falſe and diſſembling friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, then to ſee how Tyger-like, they all combine together to work the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of this poor, innocent, and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Prince who was ſeen one day to be the moſt opulent, the moſt famous, and the moſt reſpected of all Men, of his Age, and on the fame day to be made a poor, loathſom, craſy and deſpicable creature, caſt out of doors, and laid upon a dunghil all full of Ulcers from head to foot, abandon'd by his Wife, by all his Friends, by his Servants, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by thoſe friends who made up their fortunes under him, and for whom he had as great a kindneſs, as a Father could have for his Children.</p>
               <p>But alas! to ſee Friends and Favourites ſo much eſtrang'd, and ſo ungrateful to their chief Benefactours is no novelty, 'tis of as ancient a date as is, in a manner, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World; was not <hi>Cain</hi> ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and treacherous to his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> as to invite him into the Fields under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of kindneſs, but really, and with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute deſign to murther him, as it fell out, for being jealous of his proſperity, and of his

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:151886:164"/>and Priviledge as their hearts could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, but they (ungrateful Wretches) kick'd at all his kindeneſs, and reſolv'd inhumanely to rebell againſt him; and who muſt be the chief head of their Faction, but <hi>Cinna,</hi> a man ſo much indebted to <hi>Auguſtus</hi> for his manifold favours conferr'd upon him, and above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kindneſſes, for giving him his life, which he had before forfeited upon ſuch another wicked action: The deſign was laid, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that <hi>Cinna</hi> with two more of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates ſhould invite <hi>Auguſtus</hi> into his Chariot, and when he was therein, to deliver him unto his mortal Enemies, or murther him in the very place, If he had made any reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: but another circumſtance which does aggravate his ingratitude to the higheſt pitch, is, that when he had one hand extended to ſubſcribe unto this horrid Plot againſt his life, he had another ready to receive more of his favours, for at the ſame time <hi>Auguſtus</hi> made him a Conſul, which was an honour (as he confeſs'd himſelf) he durſt not ſo much as deſire. What ſhall I ſay of the monſtrous ingratitude of <hi>Brutus</hi> againſt ſo good a friend, and Father too, as <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was to him, for he was not only content to heap honours and dignities upon him, but did adopt him for his own Son, and Heir apparent to all his worldly wealth, this ſo extraordinary a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:151886:165"/>ſhould move the heart even of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Tyrants to lay down his life in defence of ſo good a friend, yet it was not able to mollify the ſtony heart of <hi>Brutus,</hi> for he was the very firſt that approach'd him with his naked dagger to give him his mortal wound in the very Senate-houſe. Theſe and ſeveral other ſuch miſcariages tarniſh'd the Luſtre of their glorious actions, and forc'd me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their Empire into another Nation, which is already come to be as treacherous &amp; ungrateful, in a manner to me as the <hi>Romans</hi> have been one to another: for I ſee they have combin'd with my Enemies to afflict and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my Members upon Earth, and leſſen the beauty and immunity of my Church-mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant: Theſe are crimes far exceeding the falſhood, and treachery of the <hi>Romans,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were Heathens, without any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my infinite Attributes, of my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Majeſty, of my omnipotent power, and alſo were depriv'd of the light of grace, which are the eminent favours I have impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; but I ſee they turn them all to the wrong uſe; which certainly will riſe in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them in the dreadful day of my viſitation.

<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joan.</hi> 2.10, 11. &amp;c</note> that whoſoever hates his Brother is in Darkneſs, and walks in darkneſs, and knows not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he goes, becauſe that darkneſs has blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his eyes; and this I think is ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the malice, hatred, and mortal animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, which Chriſtians have one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: In the ſecond place, he earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats us all not to love the World, neither the things that are in great eſteem with the World, and the reaſon he gives for it, is, that if any love the world, or its allurements, the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:151886:166"/>love of thy Celeſtial Father is not in his heart; for all that is in the World, is the Luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life, with their attendants, and ſeveral bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which thy Father hates mortally, and therefore if We pretend to be of the happy number of his Children, We muſt be of his minde; and declare by our actions the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hatred we bear them; and eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the World paſſes away, and the luſt thereof; but he that does thy will, (which is the ſame with that of thy Father) abides for ever.</p>
               <p>To begin with the luſt of the fleſh, I muſt ſpeak of the pleaſures of the Palate, which is one of the moſt dangerous branches thereof; for it deals with us like the <hi>Egiptian</hi> Thieves, that Strangle thoſe they imbrace. I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that I am amaz'd to hear of the Luxury of <hi>Nomentanus</hi> and <hi>Apicius,</hi> that entertain'd their very Souls in the Kitchen; they had the choiceſt muſick for their ears, the moſt diverting ſpectacles for their eyes; the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt variety of meats, and drinks for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and what was all that but a merry mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? 'Tis true they had their delights but not without heavy and anxious thoughts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in their very enjoyments; beſides that, they are follow'd with repentance, and their very frolieks are little more then the laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:151886:166"/>of ſo many people out of their Wits. Their felicities are full of diſquiet, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſincere, nor well grounded; but they have need of one pleaſure to ſupport another. and of new prayers to forgive the errors of their former. Their life muſt needs be wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that get with great pains, what they keep with greater. One diverſion overtakes another: hope excites hope: Ambition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets ambition; ſo that they only change the matter of their miſeries, without feeling any end of them, and ſhall never be without proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, or unhappy cauſes of diſquiet. What if a body might have all the pleaſures in the world for the asking? who would ſo much unman himſelf, as by accepting of them, to deſert his Soul, and become a perpetual Slave to his Senſes? Thoſe falſe and miſerable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates that Judge of meats by the price and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, not by the healthfulneſs, and taſt, they vomit, that they may eat, and they eat that they may fetch it up again. They croſs the Seas for rarities, and when they have ſwallow'd them, they will not ſo much as give them leave to digeſt.</p>
               <p>But what was the end of that <hi>Apicius?</hi> of that corrupter of youth, and plague of the Age he liv'd in? after he had ſpent a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious fortune upon his belly, he poyſon'd himſelf for fear of ſtarving, when he had
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:151886:167"/>250000. Crowns in his Coffers; which may ſerve to ſhew us, that it is the minde, and not the Summ that makes any man rich. But why do I call that poiſon, which was the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt draught of his life? his dayly glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was poiſon rather, both to himſelf and others. His oſtentation of it was intollerable; and ſo was the infinite pains he took to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead others by his example, who went faſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of themſelves without driving.</p>
               <p>It is indeed a horrid ſhame for a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man to place his felicity in thoſe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, and appetites that are ſtronger in Brutes. Do not Beaſts eat with a far better ſtomach? have they not more ſatisfaction in their Luſts? and they have not only a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reliſh of their pleaſures, but they enjoy them without either ſcandal or remorſe. If ſenſuality were happineſs, Beaſts were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier then Men; but humane felicity is lodg'd in the Soul, not in the Fleſh. They that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver themſelves up to Luxury, are ſtill ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tormented with too little, or glutted with too much; and equally miſerable, by being either deſerted, or overwhelm'd: They are like men in a dangerous Sea; one while caſt dry upon a Rock, and another while ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd up in a whirl-pool; and all this from the miſtake of not diſtinguiſhing good from evil. The Huntſman that with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:151886:167"/>and hazard takes a wild beaſt, runs as great a risque afterwards in the keeping of him; for many times he tears out the throat of his Maſter; and 'tis the ſame thing with inordinate pleaſures; the more in number, and the greater they are, the more general and abſolute a Slave is the Servant of them. Let Mortals ſay what they will of him, and let the common People pronounce him as happy as they pleaſe, he pays his liberty for his delights, and ſells himſelf for what he buys. But who muſt be the Purchaſer? Who? but the Devil that plays the Hoſt in this world,

               <p>A wiſe and diſcreet Traveller, when he comes into an Inn, tho' his Hoſt ſhould ſet before him moſt rare and delicate meats, to banquet at his pleaſure; yet he will forbear,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:151886:168"/>and reſtrain his appetite meerly in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the price, and of the journey he has to go; and takes nothing but ſo much as he knows well how to diſcharge the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his departure; on the contrary a fool will lay hands on every delicate bit that is preſented to his ſight, he will act the Prince for a night or two: but next day when it comes to be diſcharg'd, he is ſorry for what he had done, and would wiſh he had liv'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon bread and water, rather then be put to that vexation and diſgrace too, as to part with all his mony for his belly. The cuſtom of thy Church O Lord, is to faſt the eve of every great feaſt, and then to recreate their Spirits the next day, which is the Feſtival it ſelf. This repreſents very well the abſtinent life of thy good Servants in this World, for which they deſerve to be nobly treated, and made much of in the World to come: but the cuſtome of this World is quite oppoſite, for they will eat and drink merrily, let the Hoſt bring in what reckoning he will; but when payment is demanded, and that they can't get off without the Sum laid in his hand,

It is for this very reaſon that the Wiſe holds it better to go to the houſe of ſorrow, then to the houſe of feaſting: and the cauſe why, is, that where ſadneſs appears, there the heart of the wiſe man is lodg'd: but where mirth is, there is the heart of fools; and for concluſion, he gives me this wholeſome document, happy is the man that is always fearful, which is the ſame thing that the Holy Ghoſt recommends to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man; to walk carefully and upright with God, thinking upon his commandments, how we keep and obſerve them; how we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt temptations, how we mortify our fleſh, how we beſtow our time, talents, and riches which he was pleas'd to lend us; how we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make up a plentiful harveſt of good works for the obtaining of Heaven, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we could give him, if he had ſummon'd us at this very moment to appear before him. O that, We were ſo happy as to make of theſe good thoughts our frequent meditation, I am certain We ſhould have no time to ſpend in the idle pleaſures and paſtimes of this World, but alas! our grand misfortune is, that we never trouble our brains with 'em, we will rather think of what our Kitchens can afford. To ſee what a number of Cooks, what a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of meats a noble-man will have, 'tis to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:151886:169"/>be wonder'd that ſo much proviſion ſhould be made for one belly, and that ſo many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be employ'd to bring up the Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all taſts in one diſh, which is rather like a vomit then a ſoup; but they have their puniſhment even in this World, for from their compound diſhes, ariſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded diſeaſes, which require compound Medicines. 'Tis the ſame thing with their mind, that it is with their Tables; ſimple vices are curable by ſimple Councels, but a general diſſolution of manners is hardly overcome: They are overrun with a publick, as well as with a private madneſs. The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians of old underſtood little more then the vertue of ſome herbs to ſtop blood, or heal a wound, and their firm and healthy bodys needed little more, before they were corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Luxury and pleaſure: And when it once came to that, their buſineſs was not to lay hunger, but to provoke it, by a thouſand inventions, and ſauces. That which was ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a craving Stomach, is become a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to a full one. So that Luxury may be look'd upon as the offspring of all their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, as paleneſs in the face, trembling over all their body, a weakneſs in all their joynts, their bellys ſtretch'd,
<note place="margin">Multa fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gella pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoris. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 31.10.</note> a ſuffuſion of choler; the torpor of the nerves; and a palpitation of the heart, megrims, torments of the eyes,

               <p>What ſhall I ſay of drunkenneſs, which is a voluntary madneſs; it emboldens men to act all kinde of miſchief; it both irritates wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and diſcovers the ſame; was it not in his drunken fit that <hi>Alexander</hi> took the life of <hi>Clitus</hi> upon the point of his Sword, tho' he was the deareſt of his Friends, and the chief of his Favourits?

How many publick miſchiefs it has done, how many warlike na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſtrong Cities, that have ſtood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible to ſeveral attaques, and Seiges, has drunkenneſs overcome? how many great Armys has it defeated.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:151886:170"/>they beheld his head cut off by the hands of a Woman which was of a maſculin courage. Yet we may ſee many in the World that hold it to be a peice of gallantry to drink the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany dead? a magnificent Virtue indeed, to ſwallow more wine then the reſt, and yet at laſt to be out-done by a hogſhead.</p>
               <p>But there's yet another peice of gallantry, that is as brutiſh as th'other, and what is that? 'tis to invert the offices of day, and night: as if their eyes were only given them to make uſe of in the dark: Is it day, they will cry, O then 'tis time to go to bed. Is it night? why then 'tis time for us to riſe. They will Sup in the morning, and Dine at midnight. <hi>In fine,</hi> I muſt conclude that they are the moſt miſerable of all mortals, that deliver themſelves up to their palates, or to their Luſts: For the pleaſure is ſhort, and the end of it is either eternal ſhame, or a ſpeedy, and hearty Repentance.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay of vain-glory, which is a diſordinate deſire to be well thought of, to be in the eſteem of the World, receive the applauſe, and good word of all people, to be prais'd and glorifi'd of Men; this indeed is a great vanity, yet, 'tis the common diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of all men, and creeps into the breaſts, even of the moſt religious among them; had I ſeen a man run up and down the ſtreets
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:151886:170"/>after a feather, which is toſs'd to and fro with the winde, certainly I would imagine him to be either a perfect fool, or a little maddiſh, I can have no better opinion of a man that is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with the wavering blaſt of ſeveral mouths, for as this man might weary him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out before he got the thing which he fo earneſtly follow'd, and when he had it, it is at beſt but a feather, ſo a vain-glorious man may labour a long time, before he attain to his aim, which is a popular applauſe, and when he has it, it's not worth to him a pins head, being but the breath of a few mens mouths, that does alter upon every light oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and now makes him great, now little, now good, now bad, and at another time nothing at all.</p>

I remember in my own days, that Monſieur <hi>Fouket,</hi> the greateſt Favourite the King of <hi>France</hi> had, was inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the chiefeſt honours and dignities that a ſubject could pretend to, and his heart was ſo ſwel'd up with Pride, that he choos'd for a motte, <hi>Quo non Aſcendam,</hi> but I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alſo that all his ambition and glory va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd in one night, for the King being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:151886:173"/>of his deſign to make bimſelf abſolute Maſter of the <hi>Iſle of Rae,</hi> ſeiz'd upon his earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſtance both at home and abroad, and condemn'd his Perſon to a Priſon during his life, whereupon this Jeſt was made of him, and writ under his Coat of Arms, <hi>Quo non deſcendam;</hi> for certainly it was a prodigious toſs, to be thrown down from the height of proſperity, to the depth of Adverſity, and in one night.</p>
               <p>Now let us conſider any ſtate or dignity that we moſt affect, and reaſon thus, many have already mounted up ſo high, but they were forc'd to deſcend again, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either of Death or of Fortune, and which was the greater, either the joy of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or the ſorrow in looſing it? where are now all thoſe Emperours,
<note place="margin">Potentes potenter tormenta patientur. <hi>Sap.</hi> 6.7.</note> thoſe Kings, thoſe Princes, thoſe Popes and Prelates, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd ſo much in their days at their own advancement?

               <p>I can't better compare the vanity of this World, then to a mans own ſhaddow, which the more he runs after,
<note place="margin">Omnia arbitror ut ſtercora ut Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum lucri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faciam. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.</note> the more it flies from him, but if he flies from it, it will approach him; the only way to catch it, is to fall down on the ground upon it. So We ſee that thoſe who gap'd after honour in this World, are now ſo far from having any honour exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Perſons, that their very memory is clear out of date; whereas thoſe who have moſt fled from it, and have debas'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the very loweſt degree of mankinde through an exceſs of humility; are now the moſt honour'd, even by thoſe that were their enemies in this life. St. <hi>Paul</hi> made no more of the World and of all its honours and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, then of common dung, and who is more honour'd now then he, even in this World? who is more commended, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd in this life, then he, and all others that have follow'd his examples. We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude by this what a main folly it is to have ſo great an eſtimate for worldly honours, as to endanger our Souls in the vain and fooliſh purſuit of them. There are ſeveral other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitys in the World, which do entangle the poor Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> in a thouſand follys, which are ſo many baits the Devil flings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them to draw their Souls into his moſt

               <p>O Man!

It was never heard that I did either reject, or chooſe any man for his quality, contrariwiſe, to confound this vanity, when I came down from my Heavenly Father's Pallace upon Earth, to become man for the Redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde;

'Tis moſt certain alſo that the beginning of the Nobility of this Age, as well as of all other paſt Centurys, had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before it: ſo that of all their Anceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, ſome were ſplendid, others ſordid, as it happen'd, thou mayſt very well Judge by <hi>David,</hi> and his Brethren, what their Fathers condition was, that could afford his Sons no higher fortune, then to be private Sentinels in <hi>Sauls</hi> Army, and of <hi>Sauls</hi> Father too, by his ſending him with a peice of bread in his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket to ſeek, both far and near, for his ſtray'd Aſſes: Look upon the Nobility of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age, and read the memorials of their Extraction, thou ſhalt finde ſome good, ſome bad, ſome virtuous, and ſome godly, ſome in an eminent, and others in a very low condition; nor is it any more to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the glory of their Predeceſſours, then it is to their ſhame, the wickedneſs of their Poſterity. They are all compos'd of the ſame
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:151886:175"/>element, and therefore they ſhould not value themſelves upon their Nobility of blood, as if they were not all of them equal, when their primitive Progenitour is unknown, and that they can carry it no farther, the Herald pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides ſome <hi>Hero</hi> to ſupply the place of an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Original; &amp; there's the riſe of Arms, and Families. O, what a grand folly it is to ſpend ones life in purſuit of a title, that ſerves only when he dies to furniſh out an Epitaph; yet Nobility of fleſh and blood is a moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pearl in the eye of the World, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is to be highly eſteem'd, when it is joyn'd with virtue, and accompani'd with the fear and love of God; They are the men whom I eſteem moſt in the World,

By what is ſaid, thou mayſt conclude that where true Nobility is, there virtue muſt be lodg'd, which is the only ornament that can make them grateful to me, and give them a true title to a glorious Crown in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but where this is wanting, Nobility is in it ſelf; and in my ſight, a meer trifle, and perfect vanity; he can only brag that he is of the ſame ſubſtance with the reſt of mortals, and ſay unto rottenneſs, thou art my Father,

He that will behold the Nobility of his Anceſtors, let him look into their graves, there he ſhall finde the truth of what <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks.

And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever holds the rank and name thereof by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent only, without the Subſtance of virtue, is altogether an Alien to his Anceſtours, being he can produce nothing of their merits, and has nothing to ſhew for his extraction, but an old peice of parchment, theſe are the men
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:151886:177"/>I ſpeak of by my Prophet; They are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable even as the things which they love; their glory is from their birth, from the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and from their conception only, that is to ſay, they brag and glory of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, Progenitors, and Noble birth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, having no virtue anſwerable to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, but following their ſenſual appetites, and beſtowing their affections upon wicked and abominable delights, they are made in like manner abominable as well to me, as to all honeſt and Godly men. And in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is a moſt fooliſh vanity in ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to beg credit of dead men, that deſerve none themſelves; to ſeek for old titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from their Anceſtours, they being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves utterly incapable of any, by reaſon of their baſe manners, and ruſtical behaviour.</p>
               <p>As for the Wiſdom of the world, alas! 'tis but meer folly with me, as thou mayſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by what I repli'd to the moſt wiſe and the moſt learned men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>

               <p>My great Apoſtle, and Veſsel of election gives an excellent deſcription of the World's folly, where he ſays,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.18, 19, 20.</note> the preaching of the Croſs is to them that periſh, fooliſhneſs; but unto us which are ſav'd, it is the power of God.

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:151886:178"/>Where is the Wiſe? where is the Scribe? Where is the Diſputer of this World? has not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this World? for after that, in the wiſdom of God, the World by wiſdom knew not God, it pleas'd God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe. For the <hi>Jews</hi> require a ſign, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſeek after wiſdom: But We preach Chriſt crucifi'd, unto the <hi>Jews</hi> a ſtumbling-block, and unto the <hi>Greeks</hi> fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs, but unto them which are called both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> Chriſt, the power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Becauſe the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer then men, and the weakneſs of God is ſtronger then Men; For ye ſee your calling, Brethren, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are call'd. But God has choſen the fooliſh things of this world, to confound the wiſe, and the weak things of the world to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the things which are mighty; and baſe things of the world, and things which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd, has God choſen, yea and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are; that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence.</p>
               <p>If the Wiſdom of the World be ſo great a folly with me, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, is it not an intollerable vanity to delight and boaſt in it, ſo much as men do, and to value themſelves more upon it, then upon my wiſdom, which
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:151886:178"/>was that of my Saints. 'Tis a wonderful thing to ſee how contrary my Judgment is to that of Man; ſome will thruſt themſelves into an Eccleſiaſtical State, &amp; will conceit themſelves to be moſt fit to do the Service of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have the repute of Wiſe men in the World, but St.

An Ague of ſome four or five days will bring a great alteration upon the faireſt beauty, but half an hours abſence of the Soul from the body will make the lovelieſt face that ever was a moſt hideous and frightful ſight to be look'd upon; <hi>Iſſabella Clara</hi> was the rareſt beauty of her Age, but when ſhe dy'd, and was in her coffin but two days, one of the Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> that eſteem'd very much her beauty when living, deſir'd to have a proſpect of her face, which was then the nglieſt that ever man could behold, all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with worms, and two ill-ſhap'd ones ſtarting out of her eyes; this indeed made the good Nobleman with no leſs horrour, then admiration to utter theſe words, <hi>haec ne eſt illa Iſſabella Clara;</hi> is this that fair <hi>Iſſabella,</hi> whoſe reſplendent beauty had raviſh'd the hearts, and dazi'd the eyes of all her behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, adieu then to the World, and all its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; this was a Chriſtian Reſolution, and worthy to be taken notice of by all thoſe who beſtow ſo much labour in procuring, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their corporal beauty, as tho' all their
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:151886:180"/>happineſs conſiſted therein; nay, many are detain'd even by that only conſideration from taking a reſolution to ſerve me, ſo that this precious Jewel (as they call it) is a great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to their Salvation, as it is often the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Subject of many a poor creatures eternal damnation.</p>
               <p>But the baſeſt of all Proſtitutes are thoſe that dedicate themſelves wholly to the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance of Embroiderys, rich Apparel, Paint,

Their Luxury makes them Inſolent, and mad, They take upon themſelves like Princes and Queens, and will fly out for every trifle, as if there were life &amp; death in the caſe. What a madneſs is it for a man to lay out an Eſtate upon a Table, or a Cabinet, a hundred pound for a pair of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants to his Lady, and a far greater Sum for garments that will neither defend her body, nor her modeſty; ſo thin that one would

I was the very firſt Taylor that ever made up a garment in this World, and made it for the moſt noble of all thy Anceſtours in Paradiſe, but of what did I make it? was it of cloth of Gold, or Silver,

                  <hi>Paul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the greateſt and nobleſt Saints of the old Teſtament that they were cover'd only with goats skins, and with the hair of Camels. Does not this condemn the unſpeakable vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mortals that are ſo extraordinary curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and rich in their apparel, and take ſo much pride therein that they muſt have the ſpoil of all the Creatures upon Earth, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their backs, and adorn their bodys. From one they take his wool; from another his skin, from another his hair and fur, and from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their very excrements, as the Silk, which
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:151886:182"/>is nothing elſe but the excrement of worms. Neither are they content with all theſe rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries upon Earth; they muſt ranſack the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sea for Pearls to beautify their necks, and turn up its Sands for precious Stones to adorn their ears. They will enter into the very bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the Earth to finde out Gold and Silver, and having borrow'd all theſe curioſities of other Creatures for more vile then themſelves, they are not content to enjoy them in private, but they muſt ſhew their finery abroad, and provoke people to look upon them, as if all were of their own Stock. What an idle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency do they take to ſee Diamonds Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle upon their ſingers? and how fooliſhly are they conceited, to think the luſtre thereof come from themſelves. When Silver, Gold and Silks do gliſter on their bodys, they look ſumptuouſly, as if all that beauty came from them. When Cats-dung does ſmell in their garments they would have People believe that thoſe ſweet odours proceed from their own bodys. And thus, (ſays my Prophet) they ſpend their lives in vanity without any ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care of their Salvation; nay, they take ſuch great delight in their rich Apparel, and other vanitys, that they will bring them to Church too, that men may take the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, and whilſt they are running o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a few prayers, their hearts are taken up

I hope O man! thou art now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the truth of the premiſes; if thou can'ſt tell me any more of the World's vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, let me hear it at large, and thou ſhalt know what my Judgment will be concerning them.</p>

               <p>It was a Queſtion among the Heathen Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, whether it is better for a Man to have much, or to have enough, and the ground of their debate was, that he who has much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires more, which ſhews, that he has not yet enough; but he that has enough, is at reſt; and the concluſion was, that he is the richeſt man that is content with what he has; for why ſhould a man be reputed the leſs rich, for not having that, for which he ſhall be baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for which his very Wife or Son ſhall poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon him: That which gives him ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in War, and quiet in Peace; which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes without danger, and diſpoſes of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble, deſerves indeed the name of Riches, which alone can make a man happy in this World: for no man can be poor, that has enough; nor rich, that covets more then
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:151886:183"/>he has. <hi>Alexander,</hi> after all his Conqueſts, complain'd that he wanted more Worlds; he deſir'd ſomething more, even when he had gotten all: And that which was ſufficient for humane nature, was not enough for one man.</p>
               <p>I am very apt to believe that money never made any man Rich; for the more he had, the more he ſtill coveted. The richeſt man that ever liv'd is poor in my opinion, and ſhould be ſo in any reaſonable man's judgment: But he that keeps himſelf to the limits of nature, does neither feel Poverty, nor fear it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thoſe which the World calls happy, their felicity is a falſe ſplendour, that dazles the eyes of the vulgar, but our rich man is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and happy within himſelf. There's no ambition in hunger, or thirſt: let there be food; and no matter for the table, the diſh, and the Servants; nor with what meats na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſatisfi'd. Thoſe are the torments of Luxury, that rather ſtuff the ſtomach, then fill it: It ſtudys rather to cauſe an appetite, then to allay it. 'Tis not for us to ſay, this is not hand ſome, that's common; the other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends my eye. Nature provides for health, not delicacy. When the Trumpet ſounds a charge, the poor man knows he is not aim'd at; when they cry out fire, his body is all he has to look after; If he be to take a journey, there's no blocking up of Streets, and throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:151886:183"/>of paſſages for a parting complement: a ſmall matter fils his belly, and contents his mind; he lives from hand to mouth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out carking or fearing for to morrow. He that would know the worſt of Poverty, let him but compare the looks of the rich, and the poor; and he ſhall finde the poor man to have the ſmoother brow, and to be more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at the heart; or if any trouble befals him, it paſſes over like a Cloud, whereas the other, either his good humour is counter fiet, or his melancholly deep, and ulcerated, and the worſe becauſe he dares not publickly own his misfortune, but he is forc'd to play the part of a happy man, even with a Cancer in his heart. His felicity is but perſonated, and if he were but ſtrip'd of his ornaments, he would be contempitble. In buying of a horſe, we take off his cloths and his trappings, and examin his ſhape and body, for fear of being cozen'd: And ſhall we put an eſtimate upon a man for being ſet off by his fortune, and quality? nay, if we ſee any thing of ornament about him, we are to ſuſpect him the more for ſome infirmity under it.</p>
               <p>He that is content in Poverty, would not be ſo neither in Plenty; for the fault is not in the thing, but in the minde. It's therefore thy Apoſtle writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſays, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Rich of this World not to be high-minded,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:151886:184"/>nor place their conſidence in the uncertainty of their Riches;

The Royal Prophet ſeems to commiſerate their deplorable condition where he ſays, Alas! the Rich men have ſlept out their ſleep, and have found nothing in their hands; People in their ſleep will dream of Mountains of Gold and Silver, and think themſelves rich for ever, but when they awake, they finde they are altogether in as bare a condition as before; this is the caſe with the rich, whilſt they are in this life, they do imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Rich for ever, and that their vaſt treaſures will bear them up in all neceſſitys that ſhall occur; but when they open their eyes in the hour of death, they ſee then that
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:151886:184"/>they muſt depart for another World with as little proviſion as the pooreſt beggar in nature, I can't but ſmile to hear the Prophet <hi>Baruch</hi> laugh at ſuch People; where are they now, ſays he, thoſe great Eſtated men, thoſe mercenary Judges, thoſe deluding Lawyers, thoſe flie Attornys, thoſe greedy and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Merchants, thoſe inſatiable Uſurers that heap'd up ſuch a vaſt deal of gold &amp; ſilver, and that never deſiſted gathering together? Alas! they are rooted out of the World, &amp; caſt down into Hell-ſire; And therefore ſays St <hi>James,</hi> now ye rich men weep, and wail,

Tho' he is an Apoſtle that ſpeaks, yet his words are the very dictates of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, whereby we may eaſily conceive the dangerous conſequence of worldly wealth and the main folly of them that labour ſo much to procure the ſame, by injuſtice, and other indirect means, and when they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of them, do not imploy them to the advantage of their Souls, but lay out all to ſupport their grandeur, and ſatisfy their Luſt.</p>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:151886:185"/>
               <p>I am certain, that if an Aſſembly of the moſt able phyſitians of the World had met to determine whether ſuch or ſuch meats were dangerous to feed upon, and that they ſhould all conclude they were abſolute poyſon to the body, few, or none at all would hazard his health to eat thereof, tho' otherwiſe in ſight, ſmell, and taſt, they appear'd ſweet, and moſt pleaſant; And ſhall not the unanimous votes of all the Saints in Heaven, and of all the Catholike Doctors on Earth, together with thy moſt holy and urgent admonitions, O Lord, be able to remove the diſordinate love which mortals bear to this moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp; Soul-killing vanity? Thou ſayſt by thy Prophet to all mankind,

This expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I fear, will not at all relliſh with many of our Worldlings, who account Riches, to be their deareſt, and only Friend, nay, had I ſaid, their God, it would not be contrary to truth, for their hearts are more enamour'd with them, then they are with thee, O Lord, tho' thou haſt depoſited thy ſweet life to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom their Souls from the power of Hell,

And yet if St. <hi>Paul</hi> may be credited, they are groſly miſtaken, and wide from the mark they aim at, for where they expect their conſolation and pleaſure, they meet with their eternal deſtruction and ſorrow, for He ſays, that they which will be rich do fall into temptations, and into the Snares of Satan, as alſo into many unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; hurtful deſires, which do drown them in the Abiſs of deſtruction and Woe.</p>
               <p>Their main objection to this doctrine, is, what ſhall become of our Wives and Children, if we be not careful to provide a maintenance for them, that they may live in the World
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:151886:186"/>with as much ſplendour, as the dignity of their condition requires. But the Wife man gives them a ſatisfactory anſwer, in my minde, and a notable check to boot, for he calls them fools, and beſides, he tells them in plain terms, that their great care, and labour which they take to provide ſo amply for their Wives and Children is ſinful, and therefore will create an eternal diſpleaſure to their poor Souls: This is confirm'd by the Parable which thou didſt rehearſe of the Rich-man, who ſaid, what muſt I do, for I have no place vacant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to beſtow my Fruits? and he ſaid this will I do;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lac.</hi> 12.20.</note> I will demoliſh my Barns, and erect greater, and in them will I beſtow all my Fruits, and my Goods. And then I will ſay to my Soul; Soul, thou haſt much wealth laid up for many years; take now thine eaſe, Eat, Drink and be merry. And did not God ſay unto him? thou Fool, this night thy Soul, ſhall be requir'd of thee: then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou haſt provided? So He that impiouſly, or immoderatly lays up treaſure for himſelf, his Wife, and Family, expecting to enjoy it many years, deſerves the ſame title, and may as ſuddenly be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, becauſe he had improv'd his own Stock, and rob'd God, his heavenly King of his Cuſtom, that is, He never according to his capacity beſtow'd any part of his treaſure
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:151886:186"/>in pious works, as Gods law doth require; And indeed, if this be well conſider'd, We ſhall finde it an exceſſive folly, and maddneſs too: What can it be term'd elſe? to damn ones Soul to leave ones Wife and Children rich in the world? This is certainly the height of madneſs, and a meer deluſion of the Devil; for one moment after We are dead, We ſhall care no more for all our Kindred then we ſhall for ſtrangers; and one penny given in Alms while we liv'd for thy ſake, O Lord, ſhall bring us more comfort at that day, then thouſands of pounds beſtow'd even upon our neareſt Relations to make them rich.

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:151886:187"/>kinde of vansty; vanity in ambition, vanity in Riches, vanity in pleaſures, vanity in their corporal beauty, vanity in their Apparel; vanity in all things which they moſt eſteem; vanity in all their life, vanity in their death, <hi>In fine,</hi> vanity in their laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein their nobleſt part the Soul has the leaſt ſhare.

For the love I bear them, does far exceed that of all worldly Fathers to their Children; and the care I take to provide for them is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as great as my love; What Father was ever known to ſhed his blood for his children, as I have done for mine; or give that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to his Children, as I give to mine: I
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:151886:192"/>am both day and night preſent with them to protect and defend them from all accidents, I ſtand by them in all their tribulations to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, and ſo temper their afflictions that their extremity make them not deſpair; the Prophet Royal was ſenſible of the great care I take of my Children in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; by this I know,

               <p>There's no better teſtimony then that of a man, who knows what is ſaid to be true by his own experience; my Prophet can give thee a true account of my ardent love for thoſe that are ſo happy as to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of my Children, and Favourites, and therefore I would have thee to hear what he ſays of me, and to fix thy ſelf upon his unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable depoſition; behold, ſays he, the eyes of the Lord is upon them that fear him, and upon them that hope in his mercy, to deliver their Souls from Death.

                     <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.</note> and that with loving kindneſs I have drawn them out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to what they are at preſent, and have preſerv'd them as well from their temporal, as from their Spiritual Enemies, whilſt they remain'd ſubmiſſive to my Laws, and gave me the reverence which is expected from dutiful Children to their Parents; O ye Nations! ſays the ſame Prophet, hear the word of the Lord, &amp; declare it in the Iſles afar off, &amp; ſay, the Lord that has Scatter'd the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their Sins, will gather them again, if they will cry to him for mercy, and if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue obedient to his commands, he will keep them, as a Shepherd does his flock. For the Lord has redeem'd <hi>Jacob,</hi> and has ranſom'd him from the hand of him that was ſtronger then He. The ſame Prophet will tell thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo how ready, and willing I am to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to my Children when they repent, He repreſents me, as if I were overjoy'd at the very hearing of their mournful voice; I have ſurely heard <hi>Ephraim</hi> bemoaning himſelf thus, thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtis'd as a Bullock unaccuſtom'd to the yoak; turn thou me, and I ſhall be turn'd; for thou art the Lord my God. Surely after that I was turn'd, I repented; and after that I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, I ſmote upon my Thigh: I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd, yea, even confounded, becauſe I did
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:151886:198"/>bear the reproach of my youth: thou has heard the repentance of a ſorrowful Sinner; &amp; his firm reſolution to lead a better life for the future. Now obſerve well my joyful expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to him. Yea <hi>Ephraim</hi> my dear Son? He is a pleaſant Child indeed? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill: Therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſays the Lord. All theſe propertys exercis'd by me upon my beloved, deſerve to be ſeriouſly conſider'd, for they are certainly able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the moſt obſtinate hearts with my love, and why not, being I am ſo much enamour'd of them, tho' they be ſo refractory to my laws, and ſuch great enemies to their own welfare, that they do not regard my earneſt, and charming invitations.</p>

               <p>Tell me, O man! what greater care could be expected from a watchful Shepherd, or what ſweeter words could I make choice of to expreſs my unſpeakable kindeneſs for all mankinde, for they are the Sheep that I have taken ſo much labour and care to preſerve, they are that dear Flock for which I have ſpilt my blood, and loſt my life, and therefore thou muſt not underſtand the words of the Holy Ghoſt of any material or brutiſh Flock; No, no, He means thee and the reſt of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and therefore He concludes,

               <p>A man will eaſily diſcover the manifold mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the World, if he ſtands above it, or far off from it, even as a miſt is better ſeen at a diſtance, then cloſe by it; It's therefore that virtuous and godly men have an abſolute ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of it, becauſe that in their eminent Station, they have a ful proſpect of all its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitys; but whoſoever has any commerce with it, the firſt entertainment he is to expect, is to be led blindfold with the proſperity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that he may not ſee the miſery of his own condition, nor the way to better himſelf; &amp; in this caſe the world deals with his ſilly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, even as the Raven does with the poor innocent Sheep, the firſt thing he does before he tramples on his back, is, to ſtrike out his eyes, that he may not ſee the way to eſcape his tyranny.</p>
               <p>This is exactly the world's practiſe; no ſooner has he bereft his poor &amp; wretched Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of his Spiritual Sight,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:151886:206"/>to judge between good and evil, vanity and verity, true and falſe pleaſures, but he works him aſleep, bindes him ſweetly, and deceives him pleaſantly, torments him in great peace and reſt; gives him a Proud Spirit, which ſhall place him upon the Pinacle of greedy Ambition, and thence ſhews him all his allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring dignitys, and charming Preferments. The Worlds projects do not end thus, He has his deceitful Merchants, that when they make ſale of their Cloth and other goods, ſhew the firſt and laſt part of them, but will not admit the buyer to view, ſearch and ſee throughly, leſt he ſhould diſcover the cheat. He has ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hundreds of falſe Prophets at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to flatter, and divert him, (as they did <hi>Achab</hi>) from hearing <hi>Michael's</hi> counſel,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 22.</note> or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any notice of the torments of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that tells him of the dangerous ſtate of his deluded Soul. He has a thouſand ſlie and cunning fiſhers that will lay pleaſant baits to draw him into further miſchief. He has a thouſand times more Strumpets of <hi>Babylon</hi> at his pleaſure then <hi>Solomon</hi> had of Queens and Concubines,
<note place="margin">

<note place="margin">

We have a vulgar ſtory whoſe moral part ſhews that Riches cannot be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd without anxiety and great care, A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain man of a mecanick calling, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſupport himſelf and family but what he purchas'd by his honeſt labour, liv'd not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding very merrily; and urter'd day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo many pleaſant ſtrains, as evidently avere the products of a minde not only eaſy, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, but void of all tormenting care. This being obſerv'd by an Uſurer, (a dayly witneſs of his poor but happy life) that was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle amaz'd to ſee him ſo neceſſitous, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſo merry; he reſolv'd to try whether mony would allay, or increaſe his mirth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon convey'd a hundred pound into his homely habitation, really thinking, that Sum
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:151886:207"/>would augment the poor mans mirth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; but the concluſion was directly oppoſite to his expectation, the man quits his buſineſs, is imploy'd in counting his new-found trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; he ſung no more that day, nor did the night give him any reſt, only the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to muſe more deliberately how he ſhould diſpoſe of his Caſh, a thouſand projects pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves: either to inlarge his ſhop, or to take a whole houſe and to improve his wealth by letting of lodgings; now he was for purchaſing a ſpot of ground to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and immediately for putting it to intereſt in order to prefer his Children; in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he returns to his uſual buſineſs, but 'twas ſo heavily and with ſo dejected a countenance, that his neighbours admir'd at the ſudden change of the man, and ask'd him what he ail'd, and what the cauſe might be that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted them the hearing his delightful and merry voice that morning above all others: among the reſt the Uſurer came to ſee him, &amp; hearing what moan his neighbours made for his ſo ſudden melancholineſs, he beg'd their excuſe expreſſing himſelf ſorry that the man had loſt his mirth, that was ſo recreative and pleaſant to them, demanding withal his bag of mony, which he left there the day before; what ſaid the poor man, does that treaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to you? why then take it in Gods name,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:151886:208"/>for had it ſtay'd longer with me, I ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have run mad: No ſooner was he quit of his Mammon, but he clear'd his brows, tun'd his voice, and return'd to his buſineſs &amp; merry notes.</p>
               <p>This is an argument that Riches bring trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and affliction with them,
<note place="margin">

He is like a Clock, (which when winded up) will never leave it's motion till the weights be down, 'tis the ſame with him; his mind will never be at reſt whilſt ſo many cares, and anxietys poſſeſs it, which are to it, as weights to a clock that keep it always going; ſo when others are in their ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he is breaking his brains contriving how to manage his money to the beſt advantage.</p>

<note place="margin">Qui nocte nec die non da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiem. <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.

This is a very great affliction I confeſs, and the only reaſon hereof, is, that thou haſt taken away thy peace from ſo terrene a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, plung'd ſo extreamly in their pleaſures, without the leaſt care of their Souls, or thought of heaven; and therefore have they merited a divorce from thy mercy, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of their deplorable ſtate even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes of thy commiſeration.</p>
               <p>And really (if I give credit to what the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſays of them) their condition is ſo bad;

                     <hi>Eſai.</hi> 59.</note> that it can't be better expreſs'd
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:151886:209"/>then by his own words. They put their truſt in things of nothing ſays he, and do talk of vanitys: They conceive labour and bring forth iniquity: They break the eggs of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and weave the webs of Spiders: He that ſhall eat of their eggs ſhall dy; and that which is hatched thence ſhall be a Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice. Their webs ſhall not make cloth to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, for that their works are unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: and the work of iniquity is in their hands. There's not a word in all this, the Prophet's deſcription of the Rich of this World, but contains a myſtery: by the firſt, that they put their truſt in things of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, we may very well conceive the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Riches, which if enjoy'd to day, to morrow they may be ſnatch'd from us, and perhaps our lives too, for lucre of them: And he who takes them from us, may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe loſe them ſoon after with the ſame da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, if not a greater, I mean his Soul's loſs for ever. They conceive labour, O what a deal of toil do poor worldlings take to heap up treaſures, how many perilous voiages to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> how many tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous journeys by land, to this and that other Fair, how many dangers of being rob'd, and of loſing their lives too? Day and night they are afraid of Thieves; nay, they dare not truſt their own Servants, no, nor their
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:151886:209"/>Wives, with the keys of their treaſures for fear they ſhould rob them of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and if any thereof be taken away, O what an angry countenance will he put on! what curſes, what Imprecations will he make? What a conſternation will the whole Family be in? every one ſtriving to clear himſelf, will make his earneſt Addreſs to the Conjurer; and as he is apt to tell lyes, being ſo great a familiar with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> he may make the innocent criminal, and the criminal inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; for with him favour goes by bribing, and he that gives him moſt, ſhall have his beſt word, tho' he were the greateſt Knave in the whole Pack: this is the labour, now let us hear th'Iniquity it brings forth, is there not a wo pronounc'd to them, which draw ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with the ropes of vanity? The ſame Prophet ſays that they break the Eggs of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. <hi>Pliny</hi> the naturaliſt tells us, (and our own experience confirms it,) that the bird which ſits upon the eggs of a Serpent, by breaking and hatching them, brings forth a venemous brood that will moſt certainly be the utter deſtruction of her ſelf. 'Tis even ſo with a man that ſits (as it were) in brood upon his Riches, and does affect them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much; they will certainly be the death of his Soul, and in the <hi>interim</hi> will make him a moſt miſerable wretch whilſt he lives in
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:151886:210"/>this World, always in fear of loſing them; for they are as apt to change Maſters, as the Spiders web is to be broken with the leaſt puff of Wind: this wants no confirmation, for the man in the Goſpel ratifys it, who with exceſſive care and labour had gather'd ſo vaſt a quantity of Riches, that he was forc'd to pull down his old barns and build new to lay them in: and when that was done, he bids his Soul enjoy her ſelf, being really perſwaded he ſhould live ſplendidly and fare ſumptuouſly upon them many years; but his Soul was ſnatch'd that very night from him, and all his great preparations were uſeleſs to him. This inconſtancy of Worldly wealth occaſion'd the ſaid prophet to ſay, that the webs of thoſe weavers ſhall not make cloth to cover them withal, nor ſhall their works be profitable to them, and that none but the works of Iniquity ſhould remain in their hands: whereby he lets us know that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever loves, and follows theſe vanitys, ſhall certainly load his Soul with ſo great a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of iniquity, that he will ſink into the very loweſt Hell, where thoſe who had glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves with the World's pleaſures &amp; delights ſhall be grievouſly tormented, and then they will know that their riches were thorns indeed, that not only rent their hearts in this World, but will wound their Souls e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:151886:210"/>in the other. Theſe thoughts are now far from their minds, but when their glaſs is ſpent, &amp; that grim Death appears unto them, O how bitter will the remembrance thereof be unto thoſe men that have plac'd all their happineſs in Riches? What a grief was it to <hi>Alexander the great,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">O Mors quam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara eſt memoria tua homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni habenti pacem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divitijs ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 41.</note> that had conquer'd moſt part of the World in leſs then twelve years, to ſee himſelf ſeiz'd on by Death, and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd to appear before thy moſt dreadful Tribunal, when he deſir'd moſt to live, and taſt of the joy and delight of all his victories? What a heart-breaking will it be to thoſe that employ all their time in building of houſes, purchaſing eſtates, increaſing riches, procuring dignities, making up matches, laying out vaſt ſums to uſe, when they ſhall ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even as ſo many Princes Mules, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd of their treaſure, and turn'd off with backs gaul'd into ſome naſty ſtable, nay, it will be far worſe with them, for after their long travelling in this World, loaden with gold and Silver; which had extreamly gall'd their wretched Souls, they ſhall be disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened at the day of death, and ſent away with their wounded conſciences to the dark and loathſome Stable of Hell, there to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for an Eternity. O my Saviour? theſe conſiderations well meditated, are able to mollify a heart of Steel, to move any man to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:151886:211"/>a true repentance of his paſt follys, to breed in him an abhorrence of the world, and of all its vanitys, and make him reſolve to employ the remainder of his days in thy Service, that art abſolutely the beſt of Maſters, and whoſe rewards to thy faithful Servants are far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the pleaſures &amp; treaſures of this delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding world, as thou doſt exceed the creatures, Eternity, the Time, &amp; the eternal joys of thy heavenly Court, the ſhort and tranſitory joys and delights of this Land.</p>

How much more reaſon have I to ſay the ſame to thee, ungrateful, and diſobedient Chriſtian?

               <p>O Religious Man! hadſt thou imploy'd thy time faithfully in the ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy incumbent duty to God, and of thy main obligation to quit thy ſelf intirely of that private and proper love, which prevents thy increaſe in virtue, and which is alſo the fatal fource of all diſaſters and croſſes inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to thee in this World, thou wouldſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly enjoy plenty of eaſe and comfort in thy own mind; and thy Soul would ſwim in the pleaſant waters of my Grace; thou wouldſt alſo ſecure thy ſelf from the eternal torments of Hell, and purchaſe a moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Crown in Heaven. Moreover thou muſt know that a Religious life, is a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<note place="margin">Non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredi, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredi eſt.</note> and not to go forward therein is to go backward, which is the utter perdition of thy Soul; nay, the Holy Fathers are of opinion that it is the highway to ſempiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation. Now lay thy hand to thy breaſt, and examine what progreſs thou haſt made in this School of virtue; if after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:151886:222"/>years in Religion, thou doſt find thy ſelf as prone to Pride,
<note place="margin">

Does not iniquity bely it ſelf, thinking thou art a Religious man, when indeed thou art none at all; thou only haſt the name of one. Thou appeareſt to be living,
<note place="margin">Deviſum eſt cor eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, nunc interibun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti. <hi>Oſee.</hi> 10.</note> but really thou art dead; Thy heart is divided, and the World has the greater ſhare thereof; but what will follow? thou ſhalt undoubtedly periſh, unleſs thou doſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thy life.

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:151886:222"/>the wiſe man ſays; ſeeſt thou a man that is haſty in his words, there's no more hope of his correction then of a Fool's, he ſays in another place, whoſoever keeps his mouth and his tongue, keeps his Soul from troubles. But St.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jac.</hi> 1.26.</note> 
                  <hi>James</hi> is more plain in the caſe, for he ſays, if any man among you ſeem to be Religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is vain. 'Tis not the habit that makes the monk, neither is it the tranſporting of thy Body out of the World into a Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that makes thee Religious, as it is not thy being in the World, that makes thee a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; 'Tis the heart that does it, if that be fix'd upon God alone, thou art a perfect reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, but if thy affections be ſettled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on terrene and tranſitory objects, thou can'ſt lay no claim to the title of Religious, nor to the leaſt ſhare of God's glory. Another touchſtone whereby thou mayſt eaſily know whether thou art really a Religious Man,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jo.</hi> 13.35.</note> or not, is, if thou beeſt in Charity with all the World, by this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye have love one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: Moreover this is my precept, and it alone, is enough to work thy Salvation,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.</note> If punctually obſerv'd, becauſe that all other Precepts are virtually contain'd therein: It's therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1, 2.</note> whoever loves his Neighbour, fulfils the law, and my ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:151886:223"/>Vicar on Earth exhorts all mortals to have a mutual love one for th' other, becauſe Charity covers a multitude of Sins, And the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> after his return from his ſweet and myſterious conference with God in the third Heaven, ſays, be ye therefore followers of God, as dear Children, and walk in love, as Chriſt alſo lov'd us, and has given himſelf for us, an offering, and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God as a ſweet ſmelling Savour; ſo ye ought to expoſe your lifes for your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Monaſtical Rule, ſays,
<note place="margin">St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtical Rule.</note> that Charity revives a man in God; ſhe alone compleats the Religious man, and the Monk too; without her Monaſterys are Hells upon Earth, and th' Inhabitants are Devils, but with her, they are Paradiſes, and the Dwellers are all Angels.</p>
               <p>By the Premiſes thou mayſt ſee that Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Charity is the fundamental Virtue of a Religious ſtate, ahd of Chriſtianity too; but alas! if I judge of thy Charity, by thy beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to thy Chriſtian &amp; Religious Brethren, I ſhall find thee altogether an Alien to it; for 'tis ſaid in Scripture,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3, 4. &amp;c.</note> tho' I ſpeak with the tongues of Men and Angels, and have not Charity, I am become as ſounding Braſs, or a tinkling Symbal. And tho' I have the gift of Propheſy, and underſtand all myſteries, and all knowledge; and tho' I have all Faith, ſo as to remove Mountains, and have no Charity,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:151886:223"/>I am nothing. And tho' I beſtow all my goods to feed the Poor, and tho' I give my body to be burnt, and have no Charity, it profits no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Charity ſuffers long, and is kind; Charity Envys not; Charity extols not it ſelf, is not puffed up, does not behave it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeks not her own, is not eaſily provok'd, thinks not evil, rejoyces not in Iniquity, but rejoyces in the Truth, bears all things, hopes all things, endures all things. This is a rule which St. <hi>Paul</hi> leaves unto all mortals whereby they may eaſily conceive whether they be in Charity with all men, or not; And St. <hi>James</hi> ſays if one fulfils the whole Law, and yet offends in one point,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jacob.</hi> 2.10</note> he is guilty of all. This is thy caſe O man! if thou haſt Charity for all, and withdraws it from one Brother, thou haſt none either for God, or for thy Neighbour, no, nor for thy ſelf; for thou art void of Charity in all reſpects; and as it is impoſſible thou ſhouldſt be grateful to God without Faith, ſo it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together impoſſible thou ſhouldſt be pleaſing to him whilſt thou art not in Charity with thy Chriſtian, or Religious Brother; St.
<note place="margin">St. <hi>Augu.</hi> Ser. 20. de verb Dom.</note> 
                  <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> gives this reaſon for it; as the Church of God is grounded by Faith, and rais'd by hope; ſo ſhe receives her perfection, and complement by Charity alone.</p>

<pb n="411" facs="tcp:151886:224"/>nay, 'tis a ridiculous thing in the opinion of Worldlings: Thou wilt hear there ſuch Maxims as were never taught in any Univerſity, but that of the Reprobates, whoſe chief Preſident is the Devil that ſits night and day in the chair of peſtilence, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his infernal dictates, and diſpatching his helliſh Agents to diſperſe them in the World; but be thou careful whom thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeſt with, and be more wary in chooſing thy Company, then thy victuals, for the worſt of this can but anoy thy Body; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the worſt of that will certainly deſtroy thy Soul.
